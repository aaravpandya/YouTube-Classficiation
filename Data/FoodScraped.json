So I learned to make Mascarpone cheese at home and now I enjoy all great desserts and many other Mascarpone recipes with great taste and here is the recipe with written instructions:What is Mascarpone Cheese?A thick Italian cream cheese that tastes WAY better than store bought. Ingredients: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Whipping Cream -- 2 cups (500 ml) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Fresh Lemon Juice -- 1 Tble (15 ml)Yields:  Approx. 3/4 lb (340 g)Direction: 1.Heat the whipping cream in a non-reactive saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly to prevent scorching. 2.When the cream reaches 190 F(heat up till see you some bubbles around edges), remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Continue stirring until the cream curdles, and is thick enough to generously coat the back of a wooden spoon. Allow to sit, undisturbed, for 30 minutes. 3.Line a sieve with several layers of dampened cheesecloth (or a clean, damp cotton/linen dishcloth) and set over a bowl. Pour the cooled cream mixture into the sieve, and allow to drain, undisturbed, until cooled completely. Cover the sieve with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. 4.The next day, remove the cheese from the sieve in 1 piece and stir well to make smooth and creamy. Will keep in the fridge for 7 to 10 days. Tips: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2this recipe is easily increased -- use 1 tble fresh lemon juice for every 2 cups of whipping cream \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2use your newly made cheese to make Tiramisu, or better yet, Tiramisu Cheesecake.",

His recipes have changed the game and his restaurants are smashing successes. Although his management style is questionable, you cannot question his culinary skills! I'm just glad I didn't have him in the kitchen with me screaming \"if you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen!\", because mistakes were made. Switching the double cream for coconut cream to make the recipe vegan had some unanticipated setbacks. It took a little longer than normal for the coconut cream to set so I had to make a new puff pastry the next day and restart the recipe with a fully set cream.

Thanks so much to Tetra Pak for partnering with me and sponsoring this video.You guys know I am all about the environment, and am constantly pushing you guys to reduce, reuse and recycle. Today I am going to show you 5 ways you can move towards living a more eco-friendly life.For more information on Tetra Pak, check out http://bit.ly/2A5Fx5H Tetra Pak cartons hold a variety of products that I use on a daily basis. All the plant based milks I buy, boxed waters when I am out and about, as well as soups and on the go drinks. These cartons are a great alternative to plastic without jeopardizing quality, durability, convenience and the future of our planet. Let me know in the comments section how you plan on doing your part to be more eco-friendly! BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://bit.ly/edgyveg-cookbookSUBSCRIBE TO THE EDGY VEG HERE: http://bit.ly/1TZma0N5 Ways to Recycle Food and drink cartons:1-Recycle: Most Tetra Pak cartons can be processed at the same centers with the rest of your other recyclables. Cartons are made of renewable materials from sustainable sourcing, so they help protect natural resources and reduce climate impact. And after they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been recycled, cartons can be turned into tissue, paper products, and green building materials.2-Turn them into Plant pots: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about you, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m completely obsessed with keeping my condo filled with plants. I often clip them and replant them, and never have enough pots for all my plant clippings. Fortunately Tetra Pak cartons are the perfect material, being sturdy and waterproof.3-Composting: Because I live in a small condo, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to keep my compost in my kitchen for days, as it starts to smell, takes up a lot of space and can be an eyesore. Instead, I cut off the top of my Tetra Pak cartons and place all my food waste in there while I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m cooking. Then, when I am finished cooking I can take that to the compost chute, and rinse and reuse the carton over and over again. This also cuts down the need to buy those expensive composting bags. 4-Regrow food clippings: Did you know that many of the veggies you buy every week can be regrown in your home from scraps using just water? You can turn your otherwise discarded scraps into a whole new plant ready for you to enjoy a second time around. And you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to go buy a bunch of new pots, you can just use a waterproof recycled Tetra Pak cartons. Fill with water, place the veggie scrap and place in a sunny, warm, and well-ventilated area for best results.5-Use for crafts: keep your kids busy and creative by reusing your Tetra Pak cartons to make birdfeeders, lanterns, little houses and even snack boxes!

You CAN throw a festive vegan dinner party for under $100! Special thanks to INTERAC for sponsoring and collaborating with me on this video. #ad Check out the $100 INTERAC Challenge playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list... BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://bit.ly/edgyveg-cookbookSUBSCRIBE TO THE EDGY VEG HERE: http://bit.ly/1TZma0NINTERAC has challenged me to plan a festive dinner party that costs less than $100, and let me tell you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it was a challenge, but it was totally doable. The first thing I did when I started planning this dinner was sit down and strategize. I needed to plan out what dishes I would make and what groceries I needed. A few key things I am going to do to ensure I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go over budget is; shop at a more discount or less-expensive grocery store, use the same or similar ingredients throughout the dishes to cut back on my  shopping list, and also food waste, buy loose items or bulk items, so you only buy exactly the amount you need. The fact this will be a vegan dinner also helps cut costs, since meat and cheese are often expensive and can really rack up the bill.I paid for my ingredients using INTERAC Flash, which is super convenient when I am in a rush, or have my hands full. Plus I can use my own money-- helping me stay on track during what can often be an expensive holiday season. Trust me, when it comes to managing my money, I need all the help I can get.I hope you guys love this video and I want to know, what would you buy if you did your own INTERAC $100 challenge?

Bulletproof coffee was created by Dave Asprey, the founder of the Bulletproof Diet. Traditional Bulletproof coffee combines coffee, unsalted grass-fed butter, as well as Brain Octane Oil. Today I am using Madre Labs, CafeCeps, Certified Organic Instant Coffee with Cordyceps and Reishi Mushroom Powder and BulletProof Brain Octane Oil.These fluffy S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mores pancakes are packed with graham cracker crumbs and vegan marshmallows and topped with hazelnut chocolate spread, more marshmallows and graham crumbs. They are a fun brunch or breakfast treat perfect for special occasions, holidays, or just for fun. If you have a kitchen torch: lightly torch the garnish marshmallows until browned for a fun campfire-like look and taste. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a kitchen torch: arrange mini marshmallows on the pancake and place under your broiler to toast. THESE WILL BURN QUICKLY.Our third recipe is a florentine-style Herbed Tofu Scramble. Tofu scramble is a breakfast staple in the vegan and egg-free community for its texture, look and taste so similar to scrambled eggs!  It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a super simple, healthy and yummy savoury breakfast option that is whipped up in minutes.  I decided to make this vegan tofu scramble florentine-style to sneak in some veggies and fresh herbs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a light, low-maintenance breakfast that you can keep coming back to.Lastly, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got my diner-style potatoes. They key to amazing potatoes like the ones you get in a diner is to par-cook the potatoes. I decided to par-boil them, but you could also steam them. Then the key is to coat them in oil and let them sit in the pan untouched so they get nice and crispy, browned outsides. These diner-style home fries are well-seasoned and mixed with soft, saut\u00c3\u00a9ed onions. The combination of onion, garlic, smoked paprika, and cajun seasoning is to die for! The perfect cure after a long night out.

Cutting down on plastic is imperative to insuring our wildlife and food supply does not become completely wiped out for future generations.

I literally have cases of their unsweetened original in my office because we go through SO many cartons a week. Did you know that they grow their own almonds!?We all know that Almond Breeze is amazing in smoothies and coffee, but so many people forget or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that you can cook with it! This creamy vegan mushroom sauce recipe proves that there is so much more you can make with almond Breeze than just smoothies. This mushroom sauce is made with mixed mushrooms, rosemary, nutritional yeast, peas, parsley and more. I hope it inspire you to start cooking more with Almond Breeze! In a large pot bring salted water to a boil. Cook your pasta of choice according to package directions and drain. While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce. Heat olive oil or vegan butter in a large pot or pan over medium heat. Add minced garlic, chopped shallots, mixed mushrooms and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are browned, about 10-15 mins.Turn the heat down to medium low after 5 mins.  Sprinkle flour over the mushrooms and stir to coat, allowing to cook for 30 sec-1 min. This is what with make this sauce nice and creamy.Bring heat back up to medium-high and add 1 cup almond beverage, stirring constantly and it let simmer for 1 min. Make sure to break up any clumps. When completely smooth and thickened slightly, add remaining almond beverage and pepper to taste, return to a simmer, stirring constantly.

Also, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need an Irish holiday as an excuse to eat like the Irish. Shepherd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pie is for the Irish at heart. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a classic comfort food that probably hit your dinner table regularly while growing up, and for good reason. During the days of British India, the Indian cooks dubbed the dish \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctiffin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which basically means a perfect light snack. Although I may not agree that this dish is light per se, it definitely serves as an excellent snack, lunch, or dinner. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a prime pre or post drinking meal for St.Patties day for all you hooligans out there. So let me spill the beans (magic beans of course) on this dish. Trust me, any eejit can pull this off\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Start by preheating your oven to 400F. The meaty filling for this shepherds pie is going to be made extra meaty with veggie ground road and mushrooms. Mushrooms have a delicious meaty and hearty texture and earthy flavour that mimics animal-based meat. In a large saucepan, heat vegetable or coconut oil over medium-high heat. Add chopped onion and minced garlic and saut\u00c3\u00a9 for 3 to 5 mins, or until translucent. Add finely chopped mushrooms and saut\u00c3\u00a9 for 5 mins, until mushrooms are tender and reduced in size by half. Add veggie ground round (I like Yves or Beyond Meat), water, dry red wine, \u00c2\u00bd can of tomato paste, vegan Worcestershire, veggie or no-beef bouillon, mustard powder, bay leaf, pepper, and rosemary, and bring to a simmer. Cover the pan or pot and immediately reduce heat to medium low. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add diced carrots, corn, and peas to the veggie ground round mixture, and stir until combined. Simmer for an additional 15 mins or until the carrot is cooked tender. Add more water, 1 tbsp at a time, if mixture begins to dry out. You want this mixture to be moist, not too wet or soggy. After 15 mins, remove the bay leaf and season with salt and pepper, to taste.Now let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work on the mash! In a large pot bring peeled and sliced potatoes covered in salted water to a boil and cook for 10-15 mins, or until fork tender. When potatoes are cooked, strain them and return them to the pot. Add your non-dairy milk of choice, vegan butter and nutritional yeast, and mash until there are no lumps or clumps. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s put this thing together! Scoop the meaty filling into an 11 by 7-inch casserole dish and spread it out using a spatula. Then, spoon the mash over the filling and spread it out evenly with a clean spatula or spoon. Make sure to pay special attention to the edges. You want to create a potato-seal in order to prevent any spill over due to bubbling of filling. I like my potato layer to have a bit of a crust, so I rough up the surface of the mashed potatoes with a fork, this also helps the crust to brown nicely. Place the casserole dish onto a cookie sheet (in case of spill over) and bake for 25-30 mins or until the potato mash begins to brown. Remove the casserole dish from the oven to a cooling rack and let it sit for 15 mins before slicing and serving. Serve on it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own or with a side of baked beans, and gravy.Connect with us on the interwebs here: GET THE NEW COOKBOOK: http://bit.ly/edgyveg-cookbook Follow The Edgy Veg on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1eTMJim (@edgyveg) Follow The Edgy Veg on Instagram: http://bit.ly/18DGpxo (@edgyveg) Visit The Edgy Veg Blog: http://bit.ly/1dxcNmv Like The Edgy Veg on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1gNzEZk",

Last weekend I hosted a combined Happy Birthday Harley & Winston birthday celebration. I invited all my dog-owing friends, and those that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a dog, but love them as much as we do. I picked up some simple DIY birthday decorations on Amazon, and picked up some treats for the partying dogs Along with drinks and treats for the humans, I also decided that my dogs NEEDED to have their own birthday cake. You can absolutely find bakeries that make dog-friendly cakes, cupcakes and treats, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just as easy and a lot more budget-friendly to bake it at home. Plus, you can monitor what types of ingredients you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using. The best part? The dogs literally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care how it looks, so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be some experienced pastry chef to bake and decorate a cake that they will love.This year I decided to bake my little ones a carrot, pumpkin and peanut butter cake; three flavours they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re obsessed with. I used a combination of oat and brown rice flour to make the cake high in protein and easy to digest. The frosting is made with peanut butter and a dairy-free coconut yogurt with some corn starch for thickening. Every dog in attendance went nits for this cake, and collectively they devoured the entre thing. You can serve it plain, as is, or if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feeling creative decorate it with some of you dogs favourite treats!Connect with us on the interwebs here: GET THE NEW COOKBOOK: http://bit.ly/edgyveg-cookbook Follow The Edgy Veg on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1eTMJim (@edgyveg) Follow The Edgy Veg on Instagram: http://bit.ly/18DGpxo (@edgyveg) Visit The Edgy Veg Blog: http://bit.ly/1dxcNmv Like The Edgy Veg on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1gNzEZk",

Wewanted the wedding to provoke creativity. Being a vegan chef andfoodies, having the food up to our standards, and surprising ourguests with what was possible with vegan food was a huge part ofwhat we wanted to create as well.We wanted to express our creativity and create an experience. For us it was about having every part of our venue, and every moment that was created for each guest to be unique, memorable and almost an art piece on its own, we wanted to overwhelm people with creativity in every moment they had, like being in a playground of mini art installations for all the senses.Our ceremony was set in the courtyard of the Darling Mansion, under the overhang of overgrown vines and trees, with Chinese parasols hanging above, draped between the trees, the fire escape, and the sculptures, we had our guests and our bridal party for the ceremony. Our family friend, officiated our non-denominational service, along with a \"legal officiant\" from the city, for the signing ofdocuments. Our vows were promises to each other about how to be the best partners we can be. Poems in English, German and Arabic were read, an homage to our respective heritages. A sort of unique tradition we also incorporated was a \"ring warmingceremony\" where the rings were passed around while the poemswere read, and people in the bridal party held the rings and imbuedthem with love and well wishes. Music being an incredibly important part of our lives meant that wematiculously crafted the playlists of every part of the day. Candicewalked down the aisle to the sound of Cat Power's \"Sea of Love\"which had everyone instantly in tears, and we celebrated therecessional with Cake's \"Love You Madly\" with a ton of energy.Our 4 course french vegan tasting dinner was very private (only 35guests), and our additional guests who came to the receptionarrived outside in the courtyard where there was a satellite bar setup. So, finishing that incredibly dinner, with emotional speeches inbetween, and walking outside to the courtyard (after a fewexcellent glasses of wine ) to greet our closefriends who were all waiting for us to celebrate together was apretty incredible moment. In the courtyard, we walked up the oldfire escape and cheers with all the guests through the twilight of thestring lights, overhanging plants, and Chinese parasols. It was apretty incredible feeling. Our food was done by Acorn Catering in Toronto. They hand crafted a totally unique french-inspired vegan tasting menu, like nothing we've ever seen. It was really something else. Their attention to detail, work ethic and customer facing service etiquette was 10/10. We'd refer them to anyone.The Darling Mansion is a grand brick mansion built in 1888. This chic B&B lies in the hip West Queen West district of Toronto. An eclectic collection of artefacts and a sinfully-indulgent sense of interior design bring a surreal and Daliesque dynamic to this exciting historic property. The first floor features a bohemian dining room, drawing room and back yard garden. The second floor features four uniquely-themed bedrooms. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Opium Den\" Room, the Flamingo Room, The Magic Carpet Ride Room (with a bed suspended from the ceiling), and the Boudoir.

These are traditional golden vegan cupcakes dyed pink with homemade beet food colouring.GET THE RECIPE: http://bit.ly/EVPinkCupcakesBUY OUR COOKBOOK: http://bit.ly/edgyveg-cookbookSUPPORT US ON PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/edgyvegSUBSCRIBE TO THE EDGY VEG HERE: http://bit.ly/1TZma0NThese vegan cupcakes are delicious and easy to make! Perfect for Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day, baby showers, or whenever you pink cupcakes are required! These are traditional golden vanilla cupcakes dyed pink with homemade beet food colouring. Oh and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re vegan cupcakes, obviously. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really hard to find vegan food dye, and because I would rather not send you on a wild goose chase, I decided to dye these cupcakes with an ingredient we can all get our hands on; beets.So why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t I used red food dye? And why isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t red food dye vegan? Carmine, also known as; Cochineal, Crimson Lake, Carminic Acid, and Natural Red #4, a is a red dye derived from tiny red scale insects. Yuck, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 know about you, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather not have my cupcakes with a side of bug juice. There are so many natural and yummy ways to dye your food naturally, let me know if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like a full post on how I dye my food blue, green and even yellow, by leaving me a comment below.To make the food colouring we are going to peel, and chop 1 small beet, and add it to a blender or food processor with 1 tbsp water. Blend it until you have a thick red pulp. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re having trouble blending, add more water, 1 tbsp at a time. Strain the beet pulp, using a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth, over a glass bowl. Make sure you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using glass because it will stain anything else. Discard the solids or save for a smoothie or juice, and use the juice for dying.To make the cupcakes, start by preheating your oven to 350F and line a cupcake pan with cupcake liners. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 cup soy milk and 1 \u00c2\u00bd tsp apple cider vinegar to make vegan homemade buttermilk. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 1 \u00c2\u00bc cup flour, \u00c2\u00be tsp baking powder, \u00c2\u00bd tsp baking soda, and \u00c2\u00bc tsp salt. In a separate bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the \u00c2\u00bd cup sugar, \u00c2\u00bc cup vegan butter and 2 tbsp soft coconut oil. Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and the vegan soy buttermilk we made until well combined. Slowly beat the flour mixture into the wet mixture until well combined. Now, using an eye dropper or something else that allows you precise control, beat in drops of beet juice one drop at a time, until you reach your desired shade of pink. Scoop the batter into prepared cupcake liners, filling the cups \u00e2\u2026\u201d of the way full and bake for 20 mins, or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center. Remove the cupcakes from the oven and the cupcake pan, and allow them cool on a wire rack completely before icing.To make the vegan cream cheese frosting, beat 1 cup softened cream cheese and \u00c2\u00be cup vegan butter in a medium mixing bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, until smooth. Add the 1 \u00c2\u00bd tsp vanilla extract, and 4 cups powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, until smooth. Add the zest of lemon and drops of beet juice,and beat on high until light and fluffy. Add additional powdered sugar as needed to make a light and fluffy frosting. Pipe or dollop onto cooled cupcakes and decorate as desired.Connect with us on the interwebs here: GET THE NEW COOKBOOK: http://bit.ly/edgyveg-cookbook Follow The Edgy Veg on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1eTMJim (@edgyveg) Follow The Edgy Veg on Instagram: http://bit.ly/18DGpxo (@edgyveg) Visit The Edgy Veg Blog: http://bit.ly/1dxcNmv Like The Edgy Veg on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1gNzEZk",

According to Wikipedia, Gumbo may have been based on traditional West African or native dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish bouillabaisse, or Choctaw stew, but most likely all three dishes contributed to the original recipe. Cool!Personally, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s freaking delicious, and makes a hearty meal during the winter months. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the perfect dish for you Mardi Gras celebrations coming up next month! Yay! Let me know in the comments section below if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing anything to celebrate Mardi Gras in February.The make this Gumbo, place 1 can of rinsed young jackfruit in a medium sized bowl. In a blender, add \u00c2\u00bc tsp pepper, \u00c2\u00bc tsp mustard powder, \u00c2\u00bd tsp cayenne, \u00c2\u00bd tsp paprika and \u00c2\u00bc tsp garlic and blend to create a fine powder. Pour this powder onto the jackfruit and toss to coat completely. Set the jackfruit aside and allow it to marinate for 15-30 mins, while you prep the remaining ingredients. I used a food processor the chop the green pepper, onion and celery because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much faster than doing it by hand.Press the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSaute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 button on the Instant Pot and heat up 1 tbsp coconut oil. Add the sliced sausage and cook for 3-5 mins until it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s browned slightly and remove from the Instant Pot and set aside. Add another 1 tbsp coconut oil to the Instant Pot and press \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSaute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to heat it up. Add the marinated jackfruit and saute for 3-5 mins until soft. Remove it from the Instant Pot and set aside.Add 1/4 cup of coconut oil, \u00c2\u00bd cup flour, 1 tbsp cajun seasoning, 1 tsp thyme, and 1 tsp paprika to the pot. Whisk constantly and cook for 15 mins, until the roux is dark brown in colour. The key here is to never stop whisking. Throw on a podcast or a show in the background to keep you motivated for 15 mins.After 15 mins, add 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 chopped onion, chopped green pepper, and celery, and cook, stirring constantly, until veggies are soft, about 3-5 mins.Add back the cooked sausage and jackfruit, bouillon dissolved in water, tomatoes, okra and a bay leaf to the pressure cooker. Stir well to combine and scrape the bottom of the pot to prevent error notices on the machine. If anything sticks to the bottom, it will not bring itself to the correct pressure.Add the Instant Pot lid, close the pressure valve, hit \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpressure cook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and add 4 mins to the timer. After the machine beeps, quick release the pressure by turning the pressure valve. Remove the lid and taste the gumbo. Add 1/2 tsp salt and pepper to taste. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re watching your salt intake just season to taste. Stir in chopped parsley and serve with cooked rice.Connect with us on the interwebs here: GET THE NEW COOKBOOK: http://bit.ly/edgyveg-cookbook Follow The Edgy Veg on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1eTMJim (@edgyveg) Follow The Edgy Veg on Instagram: http://bit.ly/18DGpxo (@edgyveg) Visit The Edgy Veg Blog: http://bit.ly/1dxcNmv Like The Edgy Veg on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1gNzEZk",

GET THE RECIPE: https://wp.me/p2x3lA-36nBUY OUR COOKBOOK: http://bit.ly/edgyveg-cookbookSUPPORT US ON PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/edgyvegSUBSCRIBE TO THE EDGY VEG HERE: http://bit.ly/1TZma0NIn this episode Candice shows you a quick and easy recipe to make Vegan Chocolate Fondue right in your own home. This is a perfect recipe for Valentine's Day, or for any other day you want to make a little more special than usual. The best things about this recipe at that it consists of just 2 ingredients and takes very little time to make, and also that one of those ingredients is chocolate. The first step to make this delicious Vegan Chocolate Fondue will be to load up a medium sized glass bowl with 2 cups of chocolate chips. Put your bowl in the microwave for exactly 30 seconds. Do not make the mistake of thinking 30 seconds won't be enough, we are not looking for a total meltdown just yet. When selecting your chocolate chips get dark or semi-sweet chocolate chips as we will be transforming them into milk chocolate with our coconut milk. After heating your chocolate chips up in the microwave for 30 seconds pull them out and add in your coconut milk. This coconut milk needs to come from a can that was refrigerated upside down overnight so that all of the watery liquid is separated from the creamy part of the coconut milk. You will open up the end of the can you know has that extra liquid and drain it out. Add the remaining coconut from the can directly to your chocolate chips and cook it in 30 second intervals, stirring between each one, until you feel confident your chocolate is fully melted. Candice's batch took a total of 2 minutes in 30 second intervals.  It is recommended after fully melting that you give your chocolate a good whisking to get that velvety, creamy consistency chocolate fondue is known for. Transfer the contents of your glass bowl into a fondue pot and carefully light the burner underneath to ensure it stays warm. If you do not have a fondue pot don't fret, many pots make perfect fondue pots and there are tons of videos on YouTube to help you turn your ordinary pot into a great fondue pot. To finish off this recipe you need to get together all the ingredients you think  will be good dipped into your vegan chocolate fondue. Candice played a little game called \"What tastes good dipped in Chocolate Fondue?\" and it is still unclear whether she won or lost but she certainly did help up narrow down our focus and also walked away with the knowledge that dipping wieners in chocolate is a bad idea. Recommended dipping ingredients are strawberries, pineapples,  cheesecake bites, marshmallows, and really anything else you think might be good. Here at the Edgy Veg we wish you a very Happy Valentine's Day and hope you consider spicing things up a bit with this delicious, decadent, Vegan Chocolate Fondue Recipe.I'm the Edgy Veg, a regular gal who wants you to be able to make delicious easy vegan recipes; whether you're a veteran, becoming a vegan or just like vegan food!

FULL RECIPE: http://wp.me/p2x3lA-35wCHEESE SAUCE RECIPE: http://bit.ly/2kO66q7Wondering what to serve all your hungry and quite potentially inebriated guests during the Super Bowl celebration? You don't have to wonder any more. Candice has come up with yet another easy vegan recipe that even meat eating football lovers will gladly eat during the game.  In short, this is perfect party food. Taquito's are one of Candice's favorite party foods of all time for a wide variety of reasons. One of the biggest ones being that they are a snap to make, require minimal ingredients, minimal cooking time, and taste amazing.SUPPORT US ON PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/edgyvegSUBSCRIBE TO THE EDGY VEG HERE: http://bit.ly/1TZma0NThe first step in this recipe is to pre-heat your oven, just set it to 350'. Candice prefers to make her taquitos with corn tortillas. She says the crisp factor is much higher than any other type of tortilla and the flavor is quite complimentary to the rest of the ingredients. Take your tortillas and heat them in the oven for roughly 15 seconds each, just long enough that they become pliable. Once your corn tortillas are nice and soft stack them on a plate and get ready to assemble your taquitos. Take a bowl of refried beans and spread a spoonful of them evenly onto the middle of each corn tortilla. On top of the beans add a tbsp or less of homemade cheese sauce. Remember this is a vegan recipe, no real cheese allowed. When you have your beans and cheese added roll up your tortilla creating a taquito and put a toothpick in it to hold it all together. Take your creation and put it on a plate for now. Repeat this process making 10 to 20 of these depending on how many people you're expecting. Take a baking pan, put some olive on it and spread it evenly. Lay your taquitos down onto the pan seam first as seen in the video. Brush each of these with some olive oil as well. You will then put these into your preheated oven for about 15 minutes. After 15 minutes pull them out and flip them, then cook them in 5 minute increments and keep an eye on them so they don't burn. You do not want them to burn, trust us.  While those are crisping up it's time to get started on the sauce. You are already halfway there as you have already made your cheese sauce and surely there is some left. This is now dip. How easy was that? Your next dip is also an easy one to put together. You're going to make creamy salsa dip. In a medium sized bowl add half a cup of vegan sour cream, a 1/4 cup of salsa, some diced jalapenos, and then just whisk it all together. Voila! You now have a creamy salsa sauce for everyone to dip their taquitos in. The last sauce is pretty much a necessary item with any Tex-Mex style meal. You need to make some guacamole. This is easy as well, just cut your avocado in half, remove the seed, cut out the insides and put them into a bowl. Mash your guacamole with a fork until its fairly creamy then add in some diced onions, diced tomatoes, some freshly squeezed lime juice, and a bit of cilantro. Stir that all together well and take your taquitos out of the oven. Plate them with your sauce in dipping containers to the side and serve. Your guests will definitely be impressed, and you get to eat delicious taquitos.

            "description": "Wondering what to serve your vegan holiday guests this season? Put your mind at ease, Candice has created a recipe for a decadent Holiday Vegetarian Roast that fits the bill perfectly.  Full recipe here: http://wp.me/p2x3lA-2ZCWatch Lauren's video here: https://youtu.be/qlJHl514KY8Check out Nikky's Scalloped Potato recipe here: http://www.healthnutnutrition.ca/2016...Join our Dinner party at 7pm on Dec 9th: https://youtu.be/EIM6q8pfri0Candice has collaborated with Silk ( http://bit.ly/2hdk674 ) to bring you her recipe for an incredibly festive, pastry wrapped, side dish stuffed,  succulent holiday roast that is so much more than just something extra you have to make so your vegan friends have something to eat. The flavor combination in this roast could easily go head to head with any of the holiday classics. Candice, along with many others, has been using Silk Almond for coffee, smoothies, and cooking. They just launched their Cultured Coconut product and she's been dying to get a chance to use it in a recipe, this roast was the perfect opportunity. To make this roast you are going to start by creating your stuffing and cranberry sauce. Candice had made these items ahead of time and you can find the recipes for both on her blog.Provided you've got your stuffing and cranberry sauce under control it's time to move on the all important Sweet Potato Mash. Candice has selected 3 sweet potatoes and makes it clear this is going to be more than we will actually need. She likes to make extra because there are so many other uses for them after they are cooked. Preheat your oven to 450', then cube all your peeled sweet potatoes.  Add your cubes to a good sized piece of foil, add thyme, and then cover them as seen in the video. You will let them cook for about 30 minutes on a baking pan.While you wait for your sweet potatoes to cook you have plenty of time to put together your seitan. Start off by getting a large bowl, add 2 cups of vital wheat gluten to it,  1/2 cup of nutritional yeast, 1 tbsp of garlic powder,  1 tsp of poultry seasoning, 1 tbsp of onion powder, 1/2 tsp of white pepper, 1/2 tsp of salt,  1 tbsp dried sage, and finally 1 tsp of paprika. Whisk this all together well and then set it aside. You have now created your dry ingredients.Moving on to the wet ingredients now you are going to kick things off by adding pinto beans, vegetable broth and tahini to your food processor and blend that well. This is going to give you that meaty texture and flavor that you would have in a typical holiday roast.Now t's time to combine them. Do this by making a well in the center of your dry ingredients and slowly pour your wet ingredients into the well while mixing them both together. As you mix this you will eventually end up with what looks like dough, if it ends up being too watery simply add some additional seitan flour. Once you've reached a dough-like consistency get in there with your hands and knead it just a bit, then cover it with saran wrap and put it in the fridge so you can get back to your sweet potatoes. Pull those sweet potatoes out of the oven and dump them right into your food processor.  Add some vegan buttery spread, or any vegan butter you have on hand, a pinch of salt, and finally 1/2 cup of the Silk Cultured Coconut. The Silk Cultured Coconut is going to yield a final product that is smooth, rich, and creamy. The Silk Cultured Coconut has a few added bonuses as well, such as no added sugar and zero cholesterol. Start blending those up in your food processor and about halfway through go in and give them a taste test. Let your inner chef guide you at this point as to whether or not you need to add something extra to balance out your potatoes. Follow Candice's instructions in the video to create your foil surface prior to rolling. Once you have your foil surface made, put it out of the way so you can roll out your seitan. Cover the counter or other surface you're rolling your seitan out on with flour to ensure it doesn't stick. Now start rolling it out with a rolling pin, yes, this is going to take some time. Do your best to make it into a rectangular shape as that is important to the finished product. When you have it rolled out follow along with the rest of the video to complete this recipe. Pay close attention to Candice's foil technique and be sure to roll out your pastry dough properly. This Vegetarian Holiday Roast really is one of a kind and is certain to be a favorite at any meal, but especially during the holidays.Subscribe to the Edgy Veg YouTube Channel for regular content you can really sink your teeth into: http://bit.ly/1TZma0NFollow The Edgy Veg on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1eTMJim (@edgyveg)Follow James on Twitter: http://bit.ly/jaitatw (@jaita)Follow The Edgy Veg on Instagram: http://bit.ly/18DGpxo (@edgyveg)Visit The Edgy Veg Blog: http://bit.ly/1dxcNmvSee what The Edgy Veg does on Snapchat: edgyveg",

            "description": "Candice and James are back with another Vegan Taste test. This time they are live in the Hellthy Junkfood kitchen with JP & Julia. WATCH US FEED JP & JULIA VEGAN MEAT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppoqg...SUPPORT US ON PATREON: patreon.com/edgyvegSUBSCRIBE TO THE EDGY VEG HERE: http://bit.ly/1TZma0NJP and Julia have very little experience with vegan food so they are perfect for this taste test. The first vegan food on the taste test menu is a product called \"Dandies\" claiming to be all natural pumpkin flavored vegan marshmallows. JP states that the product looks like a glass bowl full of teeth. The lads dive in head first and find that the vegan marshmallows definitely live up to their expectations. Once James and JP finally take the plunge as well they clearly state that these vegan alternatives to the classic marshmallow are a dead ringer. They taste just like the real thing. In other words if you're a vegan that happens to be a fan of marshmallows you need to be sure to have some Dandies on hand. The next product to undergo the rigorous taste test was a vegan candy bar called Jokerz that claims to be the vegan version of a Snickers bar. That is quite a claim to make as Snickers is truly a de facto standard in the world of candy bars. Candice states that it definitely looks like chocolate, caramel and nougat. As soon as James and JP get their first bite it's clear that this is another winner, with JP even going so far as to say \"You had me at hello\". Candice and Julia state that they should really just call it a Snickers. It looks and tastes almost exactly like a Snickers bar, but it's vegan.  JP rates it at a 7 out of 10, James gives it a full 10, and the ladies both give it a 10 out of 10. This is yet another product vegans with a sweet tooth need to keep on hand. The next product tested was the Ramune carbonated soft drink originally sold in Japan that made it's way around the world due to it's unique flavor and somewhat gimmicky opening technique. Unlike a typical soft drink where you simply pull the tab, with a Ramune drink you pull a piece of plastic off the top and then press it back down on the top of the drink until it pops. The crew figured it out in no time flat and found the results to be interesting. Candice seemed especially taken by the rattling sound that happens when you shake the bottle after it's been opened.  Everyone agreed that it was good, JP claimed it tasted just like cream soda and gave it a 10 out of 10. As far as carbonated vegan soft drinks go you won't be disappointed with a Ramune. Next up was the Beyond Chicken Lightly Seasoned Strips. This is the epitome of vegan chicken. It looks exactly like real chicken, complete with grill marks as though it had just been barbecued. Julia found herself a bit confused at how it could be possible that this vegan chicken was not real meat. JP also stated it tasted exactly like real chicken. Candice has not had chicken in 7 years so it was difficult for her to weigh in on the look and texture but she seemed to enjoy the flavor quite a bit as well. Julia called it the best vegan protein that she has ever tried. JP rated it at 8 out of 10, James gave it a 9 out of 10 and the ladies both gave it a straight 10 out of 10. For all of you vegans out there craving a real chicken experience this is the product for you. The last product on the taste test list is the Beastly Sliders. Julia and Candice agree that it looks like a burger but JP doesn't agree. The entire taste test crew do overwhelmingly agree that these sliders are not the worst they have ever had, but are certainly not the best. The final verdict regarding the Beastly Sliders is definitely mixed so I wouldn't go out of my way to pick them up unless you're just dying for a vegan slider and willing to compromise a little.

            "description": "Candice is here to save the day again with an easy recipe for Green Bean Casserole that is not only Vegan but Gluten Free as well. SUPPORT US ON PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/edgyvegSUBSCRIBE TO THE EDGY VEG HERE: http://bit.ly/1TZma0NGET THE FULL RECIPE: http://wp.me/p2x3lA-2W3BUY THE INGREDIENTS: http://bit.ly/2dt4EncThis Thanksgiving you don't have to worry about what you're making for a side because this is the recipe you want. Using almond milk and cauliflower as substitutions also makes this casserole a healthy option. Fortunately, with this recipe you don't have to choose between healthy or delicious because it's both.To make this outstanding recipe you are going to start with your soup. Traditionally green bean casserole uses a can of cream of mushroom soup, usually Campbell's or a similar brand. These are loaded with all sorts of ingredients your body really doesn't need. Candice's solution is to simply make your own soup using almond milk and cauliflower. Start with a good looking head of cauliflower and cut out a fair amount of florets. The size of them should be similar to what you see in the video. Add those to a saucepan. In that same saucepan and almond milk, 2 tbsp of garlic powder, salt, half a tbsp of black pepper, and 1 1/2 tbsp of onion powder. Put the lid on this and cook it on medium high until the cauliflower is soft. While the cauliflower is cooking take a pan and put it on medium heat. Add some coconut oil in it, then put in diced onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Let those cook for about 15 minutes. You'll know their cooked down enough when your onions start to turn translucent. Now transfer your cauliflower into a blender and blend it until it is smooth with everything thoroughly blended together. Pour that back into the same pot you cooked it in then add in your mushrooms, onions and garlic. Mix that all together and let it simmer on your stove at the lowest possible setting. While that's simmering it's time to make your onions. Slice 2 onions thinly to achieve a look similar to the pile of onions you see in the video. Slicing thinly is crucial to making these onions turn out right, the thinner they are the better they are going to mix with the casserole and the better they will look topping it. Toss your chopped onions into a large bowl of almond milk, or if your prefer, soy milk. Let them sit for about 5 minutes while you make your flour. The flour you choose to use if of course up to you, however, Candice has chosen to go with coconut flour for her recipe. She has received a lot of requests for gluten free recipes and coconut flour fits the bill. Not to mention that coconut flour is high in fiber and low in carbohydrates. Add some salt, sage, and paprika to your flour and then just put your onions right into the flour mixture. Be sure to get an even coating on them as you mix them around in the flour. Your next step is to fry your onions. If you have a deep fryer you have probably already heated it up, if not, put about 2 inches of oil in a pot and put it on medium high. Once you have hot oil ready for frying add these onions in and fry them until crisp. Do not make the mistake of putting too many in at once or they will clump together. Candice recommends smaller batches cooked for 2 minutes at a time each. As you pull each batch out put the fried onions down onto a plate covered with paper towels to soak up the extra oil. Now take your green beans, cut off then ends, and wash them thoroughly. Then place them into boiling hot water for 2 minutes, no longer. We only want to blanch the green beans we don't want to boil them. Unlike boiling beans, blanching retains many of the vitamins and nutrients lost during the boiling process. It also keeps them fresh enough to still have a bit of crunch, a bonus that your guests are sure to appreciate. When your beans are done add them right into the soup, add a 1/4 of your cooked onions, and then stir this all together well. Get out your casserole dish, pour in the beans and flatten it all out. Put this in the oven for 15-20 minutes. For those of you out there that prefer things just a bit crispier 20 minutes is going to be your best option. When done pull it out and top it with the rest of your fried onions. That's all it takes to make amazing Green Bean Casserole that will truly wow your guests this Thanksgiving.Like what you see here?

            "description": "Yes, it is entirely possible to make a 100% Vegan Christmas Dinner that will not only keep the Vegans in your life happy but is tasty enough to satisfy the omnivores as well. In this episode of The Edgy Veg Candice makes the bold move of creating an entire Vegan Christmas Dinner and filming the whole process so you can follow along at home. Your first step is of course going to be gathering all of your ingredients. You can see what you will need to get in the first part of the video. Definitely be sure you have mushrooms, green beans, rolls, carrots, vegan cheese, potatoes, vegan milk, and more on hand.  The main part of this meal will be the Seitan en Croute, better known as Beef Wellington. You can find the full recipe for this on the channel at the link below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORRY...Make as many of these as you need to feed your guests. One of these is generally enough for two people. What Christmas dinner would be complete without stuffing? Candice has also already made a video detailing how to create your vegan stuffing which you can find on the channel right here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOxrA...Essentially it consists of day old bread broken into pieces and mixed with parsley, sage, poultry seasoning, celery, thyme, and a bit of fleur de sel. Add sauteed onions to that mixture along with vegetable stock and put it into a casserole dish. Stick that in the oven and move on to your next dish. You can find more precise and complete directions at the link above. Moving right along, it's time to take out some of that inner rage and smash some potatoes. Everyone knows how to make mashed potatoes, but do you know how to make smashed potatoes? Boil some good sized potatoes until they are somewhat soft, put them on a baking sheet and smash them each fairly flat with a tumbler or some other tumbler sized object. Drizzle a bit of olive oil on each one, add freshly crushed pepper and a pinch of salt, then place them into the oven along with your stuffing. Next on the list is carrots and green beans. Candice is a big fan of roasted carrots and green beans so that's what she's going with for this dinner. Chop the ends off of your carrots and peel them putting them into a baking dish and drizzling them with a bit of olive oil followed by some crushed black pepper, salt, and garlic powder. Follow the same process to make your green beans with the exception of course that you won't be peeling them, you'll be chopping off the ends. Put both of these into your now no doubt nearly full oven. Our next step will be to create our cranberry sauce. Candice claims that no one really eats the cranberry sauce except her and one other guest. Regardless, she's going to make it, and she's going to make it from scratch. Add fresh cranberries to a sauce-pot, add in brown sugar, raw sugar, and some fresh squeezed orange juice. Set your heat somewhere between medium and medium-high and soon you will start hearing pops. Let that continue to cook down, feel free to mash up your cranberries if you see fit, or just leave them whole. The important part here is that they get soft. By now most of what's in your oven is going to be cooked, be sure to keep an eye on it and not overcook it. The more prepared you can be for your guests the less stressed out you'll be when the magic hour arrives to serve them Christmas dinner. Pull out all the dishes that are done and cover them with tin foil setting them on the counter. Now it's time to make some garlic aoli. In a mixing bowl add vegan mayonnaise, garlic, fresh lemon juice and whisk well. After mixing add just a touch of paprika and whisk again. That is all there is to making delicious vegan garlic aoli.For dessert Candice has chosen to make Rafeallo. Unfortunately we are out of space to write any more about this Vegan Christmas Dinner so you'll just have to follow along with the video to make this epic dessert.That completes this Vegan Holiday Christmas Dinner video. After watching this, and following a few of the links above you should have no trouble creating your very own vegan holiday dinner. Like what you see here?

Before we begin, please subscribe if you like my stuff!  http://www.youtube.com/stillcurrentst...I forgot to mention how much peanut butter to put in the cookies in the video, which is kind of imporant :)  It's half a cup.  Also, I use earth balance for all my butter substitution needs, it's the best I've found so far.  Try your cookies part of my vegan breakfast (really), I love them in the morning.Here's the best tip on how to cook them:  When you've got your dough ready, roll it into a log (not the captain's kind) 3\" in diameter, then wrap said \"log\" saran wrap and refrigerate it for 2 hours.  Then cut into 1cm pieces and put on parchment paper and on a cookie tray, then put in the oven at 350 for exactly 13 minutes.  When you take them out the cookies will look all soft and mushy... but wait, they're not going to stay that way.  Carefully transfer them to some sort of rack that will allow them breathe from beneath (you could wait for your oven to cool and put them there if you want).  Now wait until they have cooled.  you will now have the best textured vegan cookie on the planet, crispy on the outside and soft and silky on the inside, mmmmmmmm.---Please subscribe to StillCurrent! here:  http://www.youtube.com/stillcurrentst...I'm the EdgyVeg, a regular person who wants you to be able to make easy vegan recipes, whether you're a veteran or becoming a vegan.

Don't eat refined sugar because it's crap.Why a balsamic glaze:  Did you know that it's made from a grape? Yup, the white Trebbiano grapes, which are grown in Northern Italy.  And balsamic is great weight loss substitute for most store bought marinades, because it suppresses the body's appetite and helps you lose weight because your stomach takes longer to empty once you've eaten it!

We're talking about wheat meat here...  not about Beelzebub :)  Today I make a Vegan seitan turkey recipe completely from scratch.The secret ingredients:- vital wheat gluten- garbanzo bean flour.Also known as:Wheat meat (I like that one), Mock Duck, gluten meat, or just plain gluten.  It is a food made from the gluten of wheat.Texture: When you try it, you'll notice that Seitan is quite chewy, more like meat.  You know Tempeh?  Well tempeh can also be used to create mock meat, but the difference I find is that Tempeh is dryer than seitan, so seitan is good in dishes requiring more density such as mock turkey, beef, gravies.What about the calories in this vegan recipe?  according to a calorie counting website seitan has less calories than tempeh, but also less fibre.---I'm the EdgyVeg, a Vegan blogger who wants you to love what you eat regardless of your food preference!Check out The Edgy Veg on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/edgyveg?ref=tsFollow @edgyveg on Twitter - https://twitter.com/#!/edgyvegVisit The Edgy Veg website here - http://www.theedgyveg.comMy channel is at Still Current Studios so please subscribe!
