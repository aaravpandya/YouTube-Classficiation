During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job.

I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQQ How do you work together with brands?A Watch this video with the complete and honest truth about travel vlogging: https://youtu.be/ntL0MhxSneQ",

I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences.

If you are planning to travel to South East Asia and Thailand for a vacation or your gap year, please be careful where you spend your money. One thing is certain, when traveling you will see businesses for elephant treks, elephant rides, and elephant shows where elephants play soccer, paint, and do unnatural tricks. Rather than getting that picture for Instagram or social media of you riding an elephant, consider choosing to spend your money at sanctuaries where the elephants are able to live and behave more naturally. If the tourist money is flowing to nature reserves and elephant rescues instead of rides and shows, the market will change itself and life will improve for these gentle animals.This film was made in collaboration with the amazing @blakedaveyhttp://www.blakedavey.com/Huge thank you to Lek with Elephant Nature ParkGet involved: https://www.saveelephant.org/Thank you to Leanne Fogarty with Elephanaticshttps://elephanatics.org/Thank you to PETA for the Phajaan (Elephant Crush) footagehttps://www.peta.orgSee more of what I'm up toInstagram https://www.instagram.com/lostleblancFacebook LostLeBlancTwitter LostLeBlancSnapChat LostLeBlancSongs:All Music used is from this website.
