                "description": "After the fall of the Qing dynasty China fell apart and both, forces loyal to Chiang Kais-shek's National Kuomintang Party and as Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China, fought to rule the country. This bloody struggle would ultimately result in the Chinese Civil War. It would take more than 22 years but would come to a halt during the 2nd Sino-Japanese War. After Japan's defeat, Mao's troops grew strong quickly and soon after they were able to force Chiang Kai-shek and his followers out of China. They sought refuge in Taiwan. Shortly after, Mao Zedong called out the People's Republic of China.

                    "description": "After the fall of the Qing dynasty China fell apart and both, forces loyal to Chiang Kais-shek's National Kuomintang Party and as Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China, fought to rule the country. This bloody struggle would ultimately result in the Chinese Civil War. It would take more than 22 years but would come to a halt during the 2nd Sino-Japanese War. After Japan's defeat, Mao's troops grew strong quickly and soon after they were able to force Chiang Kai-shek and his followers out of China. They sought refuge in Taiwan. Shortly after, Mao Zedong called out the People's Republic of China.

                "description": "The oppression of the Chinese people during the first half of the Century of Humiliation increased unrest in the country. More and more revolutionary groups formed and tried to destroy the ruling Qing dynasty. The Qing would finally fall by 1912, and because Sun Yat-sen had passed on his role as the new president of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai took power. Later however Sun Yat-sen's Chinese National Party Kuomintang would try to overthrow Yuan's Beiyang government and unify the country. The Kuomintang defeated the Beiyang government in 1928 under its new anti-Communist leader Chiang Kai-shek. Reuniting China would have to wait until after the Second World War had ended. It would be the Communist leader Mao Zedong who would, on October 1 1949, declare the People's Republic of China.

                    "description": "The oppression of the Chinese people during the first half of the Century of Humiliation increased unrest in the country. More and more revolutionary groups formed and tried to destroy the ruling Qing dynasty. The Qing would finally fall by 1912, and because Sun Yat-sen had passed on his role as the new president of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai took power. Later however Sun Yat-sen's Chinese National Party Kuomintang would try to overthrow Yuan's Beiyang government and unify the country. The Kuomintang defeated the Beiyang government in 1928 under its new anti-Communist leader Chiang Kai-shek. Reuniting China would have to wait until after the Second World War had ended. It would be the Communist leader Mao Zedong who would, on October 1 1949, declare the People's Republic of China. Learn all about the era that led to the founding of the People's Republic of China in our second special on The Century of Humiliation.\n\n\u00bb The Complete PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/HistoryOfChina\n \n\u00bb  Mentioned Videos:\n\nThe Century of Humiliation Part 1: http://bit.ly/1JwNMW7\n\nSun Yat-sen: http://bit.ly/SunYat-sen\n\nThe Boxer Rebellion: http://bit.ly/TheBoxers\n\n\u00bb JOIN OUR COMMUNITY FOR MORE HISTORY KNOWLEDGE!\nWrite us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/ITSHISTORYfb\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/thehistoryshow\nYour photos on Instagram: https://instagram.com/itshistorychannel\n\n\u00bb Interested in the First World War?

                "description": "Yankee Girl Finds Confederate Relics Metal Detecting is the hunt for buried treasure; we take one of our History Seekers genealogy researchers to find her first relics from 1864. This was from a time when the North and the South were locked in a bitter fight that pitted brother against brother. She said her find of a lifetime was to find miniball or other related relics and any old silver coins would just be a bonus. She was able to see the challenges the soldiers would have faced almost exactly 155 years ago at the time these relics came out of the ground as we dug these relics in 2019.

This was from a time when the North and the South were locked in a bitter fight that pitted brother against brother. She said her find of a lifetime was to find miniball or other related relics and any old silver coins would just be a bonus. She was able to see the challenges the soldiers would have faced almost exactly 155 years ago at the time these relics came out of the ground as we dug these relics in 2019.

METAL DETECTING 2019: In our latest video we are detecting a known Civil War camp that was used mostly by both confederate forces and also at other times union throughout the Civil War. We have also found evidence of Andrew Jackson\u2019s forces using this camp during the Creek Indian wars during 1813. While relic hunting we find a host of treasures that include civil war bullets, buttons, iron relics and more.

METAL DETECTING 2019: In our latest video we are detecting a known Civil War camp that was used mostly by both confederate forces and also at other times union throughout the Civil War. We have also found evidence of Andrew Jackson\u2019s forces using this camp during the Creek Indian wars during 1813. While relic hunting we find a host of treasures that include civil war bullets, buttons, iron relics and more. While we may appear to be treasure hunters, we never sell any of the relics found and often loan to museums. We do this for the love of history and we enjoy using metal detectors. In this video you will see our friends Mark and Justin Emmons as they visit Alabama from Kentucky. Any time you see fire pits with ash that are 150 years old it is cool but the things that can can come out of them are amazing no matter if you are a relic hunter or hunt just for silver coins.

The Tennesee militia led by Andrew Jackson with officers such as Sam Houston and Davey Crockett that fought battles against the Red Stick Creek Indians throughout Alabama led by Red Eagle. We are on a mission to find the camps they used along the way using metal detectors and new mapping technology. We have found amazing relics related to this historical event that you will not believe and feel that we are on the verge of finding much more. If you are interested in History, metal detecting, relic hunting, artifact hunting, archaeology, Native American History, and United States History this series is for you. While we may appear to be treasure hunters, we never sell any of the relics found and commonly put items in museums on loan at no cost. No matter which side you believe was right on the issue we make this all about the history. It took Andrew Jackson to the President of the United States after repelling the British invasion at New Orleans, Davey Crockett to be a folk hero, and Sam Houston to be a Senator, Governor of Tennessee, President of Texas when it was a country, and later Governor of Texas. These relics that we find could have been touched by these men that shaped our nations destiny and you are along for the journey to see these rare relics uncovered for the first time since 1813! Metal arrow heads, musket balls, buttons, coins, artifacts, rings, and much more from brave warriors on both sides. \n\nWe are also doing a giveaway of a Minelab Equinox 800 when we reach 10,000 subscribers.

Could we be close to finding more silver coins or are these coins from the revenuers that destroyed the moonshine still. We were joined by our friend and fellow YouTube channel personality Brandon from Adventure Archaeology.  The treasure hunter comes out in everyone when you see silver coins and old mason jars in one area. Could we be close to a silver cache / hoard ? We were exploring the woods when we made the amazing coin and relic finds. Heath Jones and Scott Duncan were using the Minelab Equinox 800 metal detectors while Brandon uses the Fisher F75. We were also looking for old valuable coins, old bottles, relics, and privies. Exploration and treasuring hunting in the deep woods of Alabama can turn up almost anything. They give most items found to the land owner or loan to museums and have never sold a relic they find. Their finds are often published in American Digger Magazine. Come and join in while we explore the back woods / mountains of Alabama not to mention we are also giving away a prize that you see found in the video to random commenters.

Could we be close to finding more silver coins or are these coins from the revenuers that destroyed the moonshine still. We were joined by our friend and fellow YouTube channel personality Brandon from Adventure Archaeology.  The treasure hunter comes out in everyone when you see silver coins and old mason jars in one area. Could we be close to a silver cache / hoard ? We were exploring the woods when we made the amazing coin and relic finds. Heath Jones and Scott Duncan were using the Minelab Equinox 800 metal detectors while Brandon uses the Fisher F75. We were also looking for old valuable coins, old bottles, relics, and privies. Exploration and treasuring hunting in the deep woods of Alabama can turn up almost anything. They give most items found to the land owner or loan to museums and have never sold a relic they find. Their finds are often published in American Digger Magazine. Come and join in while we explore the back woods / mountains of Alabama not to mention we are also giving away a prize that you see found in the video to random commenters.

Rare solider owned items that may be the only ones known left exist in the world or only one of a few. They find military badges, medals, old coins, tokens, relics, and other treasures. We even find silver and gold at times! These items are commonly published in American Digger Magazine. Some of these items are valuable and some are just historically important.

There is something very satisfying to touch a bullet that nobody has held since the soldier dropped it in the American Civil War. While we have never sold any of our relics it is nice to know when you find a valuable or expensive piece of history that is highly collectible.

                "description": "Siberia is characterised by a great deal of variety in climate, vegetation, and landscape. The climate in Siberia is very variable. Agriculture is only possible in Siberia without artificial irrigation today between 50\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 north. \n\nFinds from the Lower Paleolithic appear to be attested between east Kazakhstan and Altai. In the Upper Palaeolithic, by contrast, most remains are found in the Urals, in Altai, on the upper Yenissei, west of Lake Baikal and on the shore of the Laptev Sea. The Siberian Palaeolithic continues well into the European Mesolithic. \n\nIn north Asia, the Neolithic, which was between 5500 and 3400 B.C. is mostly a chronological term, since there is no evidence for agriculture or even pastoralism in Siberia during the central European Neolithic. In the second half of the third millennium B.C., bronze working reached the cultures of western Siberia. In the middle Bronze Age, between 1800 and 1500 B.C., the west Siberian Andronovo culture expanded markedly to the east and even reached the Yenissei valley. \n\n------------------------------------------\nCreated with Camtasia Studio.\nInformation and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

                    "description": "Siberia is characterised by a great deal of variety in climate, vegetation, and landscape. The climate in Siberia is very variable. Agriculture is only possible in Siberia without artificial irrigation today between 50\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 north. \n\nFinds from the Lower Paleolithic appear to be attested between east Kazakhstan and Altai. In the Upper Palaeolithic, by contrast, most remains are found in the Urals, in Altai, on the upper Yenissei, west of Lake Baikal and on the shore of the Laptev Sea. The Siberian Palaeolithic continues well into the European Mesolithic. \n\nIn north Asia, the Neolithic, which was between 5500 and 3400 B.C. is mostly a chronological term, since there is no evidence for agriculture or even pastoralism in Siberia during the central European Neolithic. In the second half of the third millennium B.C., bronze working reached the cultures of western Siberia. In the middle Bronze Age, between 1800 and 1500 B.C., the west Siberian Andronovo culture expanded markedly to the east and even reached the Yenissei valley. \n\n------------------------------------------\nCreated with Camtasia Studio.\nInformation and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

The Libyans wanted to demonstrate against the increasing likelihood that Egypt would enter into a peace treaty with Israel. On July 20, after the protest march was stopped by Egyptian border guards, Libyan artillery units fired at Egypt in Sallum.\n\nOn July 21, 1977 Libyan forces carried out a raid on Sallum. The raid was carried out by the 9th Tank Battalion and supported by a few Mirage 5 aircraft.\n\nAnwar Sadat and his generals ordered 3 divisions to head to the Libyan border when news of the advancing Libyan tanks reached them. The three divisions quickly beat back the Libyan brigades, destroying most of their equipment. The Egyptian Air Force and 3 divisions of the Egyptian Army stormed across the Libyan border and captured some key border towns. Libyan military bases in Al Adm (Gamal Abdul El Nasser Air Base), Kufra and Umm Alayan were bombed.\n\nOther Arab states then asked Sadat not to launch a full-scale invasion of Libya (which Sadat and his generals allegedly planned on doing on 26 July). Sadat heeded their call and forced Libya into a ceasefire. The Egyptian Army then withdrew from occupied territory.\n\n------------------------------------------\nCreated with Camtasia Studio.\nInformation and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

                    "description": "The Libyan\u2013Egyptian War was a short border war between Libya and Egypt in July 1977.\n\nIn June 1977, thousands of Libyan protesters began a \"March on Cairo\" as they headed towards the Egyptian border. The Libyans wanted to demonstrate against the increasing likelihood that Egypt would enter into a peace treaty with Israel. On July 20, after the protest march was stopped by Egyptian border guards, Libyan artillery units fired at Egypt in Sallum.\n\nOn July 21, 1977 Libyan forces carried out a raid on Sallum. The raid was carried out by the 9th Tank Battalion and supported by a few Mirage 5 aircraft.\n\nAnwar Sadat and his generals ordered 3 divisions to head to the Libyan border when news of the advancing Libyan tanks reached them. The three divisions quickly beat back the Libyan brigades, destroying most of their equipment. The Egyptian Air Force and 3 divisions of the Egyptian Army stormed across the Libyan border and captured some key border towns. Libyan military bases in Al Adm (Gamal Abdul El Nasser Air Base), Kufra and Umm Alayan were bombed.\n\nOther Arab states then asked Sadat not to launch a full-scale invasion of Libya (which Sadat and his generals allegedly planned on doing on 26 July). Sadat heeded their call and forced Libya into a ceasefire. The Egyptian Army then withdrew from occupied territory.\n\n------------------------------------------\nCreated with Camtasia Studio.\nInformation and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

                "description": "The American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and as the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and those thirteen of its North American colonies which after the onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America.\n\nOn December 16, 1773, Massachusetts members of the Patriot group Sons of Liberty destroyed a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor in an event that became known as the Boston Tea Party. British attempts to seize the munitions of Massachusetts colonists in April 1775 led to the first open combat between Crown forces and Massachusetts militia, the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775.  The Continental Congress appointed George Washington to take command of the militia. Later he was appointed as commander-in-chief of the newly formed Continental Army, as well as coordinating state militia units.\n\nOn July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress formally voted for independence, issuing its Declaration on July 4. \n\nWashington captured a Hessian force at Trenton and drove the British out of New Jersey, restoring American confidence. British general, Burgoyne outran his supplies, was surrounded and surrendered at Saratoga in October 1777. In 1778 France formally entered the war, signing a military alliance that recognized the independence of the United States. \n\nIn 1781, after the British and their allies had suffered two decisive defeats at King's Mountain in October 1780 and Cowpens in January 1781, Cornwallis retreated to Virginia, intending on evacuation. A joint Franco-American army led by Count Rochambeau and Washington, laid siege to the British forces at Yorktown. With no sign of relief and the situation untenable, Cornwallis surrendered in October 1781.\n\nOn September 3, 1783, the combatants signed the Treaty of Paris, ending the war. Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States over the territory bounded roughly by present-day Canada to the north, by Florida to the south, and by the Mississippi River to the west.\n\n------------------------------------------\nCreated with Camtasia Studio.\nInformation and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

Concrete-like materials were used since 6500 B.C. by the Nabataea traders or Bedouins who occupied and controlled a series of oases and developed a small empire in the regions of southern Syria and northern Jordan. \n\nThe earliest large-scale users of concrete technology were the ancient Romans, and concrete was widely used in the Roman Empire. During the Roman Empire, Roman concrete (or opus caementicium) was made from quicklime, pozzolana and an aggregate of pumice. \n\nIn 1824 Joseph Aspdin invented the modern Portland cement. He named his cement Portland, after a rock quary that produced very strong stone. \n\nIn 1849 Joseph Monier invented the reinforced concrete. \n\nIn 1930, air entraining agents were used for the first time in concrete to resist against damage from freezing and thawing.\n\n------------------------------------------\nCreated with Camtasia Studio.\nInformation and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

                    "description": "Concrete is a composite material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time.\n\nSmall usages of concrete go back for thousands of years. Concrete-like materials were used since 6500 B.C. by the Nabataea traders or Bedouins who occupied and controlled a series of oases and developed a small empire in the regions of southern Syria and northern Jordan. \n\nThe earliest large-scale users of concrete technology were the ancient Romans, and concrete was widely used in the Roman Empire. During the Roman Empire, Roman concrete (or opus caementicium) was made from quicklime, pozzolana and an aggregate of pumice. \n\nIn 1824 Joseph Aspdin invented the modern Portland cement. He named his cement Portland, after a rock quary that produced very strong stone. \n\nIn 1849 Joseph Monier invented the reinforced concrete. \n\nIn 1930, air entraining agents were used for the first time in concrete to resist against damage from freezing and thawing.\n\n------------------------------------------\nCreated with Camtasia Studio.\nInformation and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

At that time, Rome was no longer the capital of the Western Roman Empire, having been replaced in that position first by Mediolanum in 286 and then by Ravenna in 402. The empire was lead at the time of the sack by emperor Honorius, son of Emperor Theodosius who died in 395.\n\nOn August 24, 410, the Visigoths entered Rome through its Salarian Gate, according to some opened by treachery, according to others by want of food, and pillaged the city for three days. Because the barbarians had converted to Christian sect Arianism, it was not a particularly violent looting with relatively little rape, murder and damage to buildings.\n\nThis was the first time Rome had been sacked in 800 years, after this was done by Gallic tribes led by Brennus in 390 BC. It was shocking to people across both halves of the Empire who viewed Rome as the eternal city and the symbolic heart of their empire. \n\n------------------------------------------\nCreated with Camtasia Studio.\nInformation and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

                    "description": "The Sack of Rome which occurred on August 24, 410, was done by the Visigoths led by King Alaric. At that time, Rome was no longer the capital of the Western Roman Empire, having been replaced in that position first by Mediolanum in 286 and then by Ravenna in 402. The empire was lead at the time of the sack by emperor Honorius, son of Emperor Theodosius who died in 395.\n\nOn August 24, 410, the Visigoths entered Rome through its Salarian Gate, according to some opened by treachery, according to others by want of food, and pillaged the city for three days. Because the barbarians had converted to Christian sect Arianism, it was not a particularly violent looting with relatively little rape, murder and damage to buildings.\n\nThis was the first time Rome had been sacked in 800 years, after this was done by Gallic tribes led by Brennus in 390 BC. It was shocking to people across both halves of the Empire who viewed Rome as the eternal city and the symbolic heart of their empire. \n\n------------------------------------------\nCreated with Camtasia Studio.\nInformation and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

They defeated the Visigothic army, led by King Roderic, in a decisive battle at Guadalete in 712.

The Norse, who had settled Greenland and Iceland, arrived around the year 1000 and built a small settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows, at the northernmost tip of Newfoundland. \n\nJohn Cabot became the first European known to have landed in Canada after the time of the Vikings. Based on the Treaty of Tordesillas, the Spanish Crown claimed it had territorial rights in the area visited by John Cabot in 1497 and 1498.  However, Portuguese explorers like Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador would continue to visited the north Atlantic coast, which accounts for the appearance of \"Labrador\" on topographical maps of the period.\n\nFrench interest in the New World began with Francis I of France, who in 1524 sponsored Giovanni da Verrazzano to navigate the region between Florida and Newfoundland in hopes of finding a route to the Pacific Ocean. In 1534, Jacques Cartier planted a cross in the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula and claimed the land in the name of Francis I. On 3 July 1608 Samuel de Champlain founded what is now Quebec City, probably the earliest permanent settlement in present-day Canada , which would become the capital of New France.\n\n------------------------------------------\nCreated with Camtasia Studio.\nInformation and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

However, Portuguese explorers like Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador would continue to visited the north Atlantic coast, which accounts for the appearance of \"Labrador\" on topographical maps of the period.\n\nFrench interest in the New World began with Francis I of France, who in 1524 sponsored Giovanni da Verrazzano to navigate the region between Florida and Newfoundland in hopes of finding a route to the Pacific Ocean. In 1534, Jacques Cartier planted a cross in the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula and claimed the land in the name of Francis I. On 3 July 1608 Samuel de Champlain founded what is now Quebec City, probably the earliest permanent settlement in present-day Canada , which would become the capital of New France.\n\n------------------------------------------\nCreated with Camtasia Studio.\nInformation and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

                    "description": "The Hundred Years War was a long conflict between England and France in Middle Ages, for the throne of France and for French territories. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the Middle Ages, in which five generations of kings from two rival dynasties, House of Plantagenet, rulers of the Kingdom of England and House of Valois, rulers of the Kingdom of France fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in Western Europe. The war marked both the height of chivalry and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong national identities in both countries.\n\nIn this video you can learn all you should know about the causes of the war, the timeline, the main battles, and the aftermatch. Also here is a lot of information about main players of the war: king Edward III, Charles IV, Black Prince, Henry V, Joan of Arc, Charles VI and many others.\n\n------------------------------------------\nCreated with Camtasia Studio.\nInformation and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

                "description": "The Epic of Gilgamesh is an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia that is often regarded as the earliest surviving great work of literature. The literary history of Gilgamesh begins with five Sumerian poems about Bilgamesh (Sumerian for \"Gilgamesh\"), king of Uruk, dating from the Third Dynasty of Ur (c.\u20092100 BC). These independent stories were later used as source material for a combined epic in Akkadian. The first surviving version of this combined epic, known as the \"Old Babylonian\" version dates to the 18th century BC and is titled after its incipit, Sh\u016btur eli sharr\u012b (\"Surpassing All Other Kings\"). Only a few tablets of it have survived. The later \"standard\" version compiled by S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni dates from the 13th to the 10th centuries BC and bears the incipit Sha naqba \u012bmuru (\"He who Saw the Abyss\", in modern terms: \"He who Sees the Unknown\"). Approximately two thirds of this longer, twelve-tablet version have been recovered. Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThis video is extract from 36 Lectures course called \"Between the Rivers: The History of Ancient Mesopotamia\" instructed by Professor Alexis Q.

This initial migration was followed by other archaic humans including H. heidelbergensis, which lived around 500,000 years ago and was the likely ancestor of both Denisovans and Neanderthals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first clip is extracted from 36 Lectures course called \"A Brief History of the World\" instructed by Professor Peter N.

Unresolved rivalries at the end of the conflict contributed to the start of the Second World War twenty-one years later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nthe first clip 00:00 - 08:23 is extracted from 36 Lectures course called \"World War I: The \"Great War\"\" instructed by Professor Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius\n\nFor more information Please visit https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/world-war-i-the-great-war.html\n\n\n-----------\n\n\nthe second clip 08:24 - 11:19 is extracted from 36 Lectures course called \"War, Peace, and Power: Diplomatic History of Europe, 1500-2000\" instructed by Professor Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius\n\nFor more information Please visit https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/war-peace-and-power-diplomatic-history-of-europe-1500-2000.html\n\n\n\n------------\n\n\n\nthe third clip 11:20 - 23:00 is extracted from 36 Lectures course called \"The Ottoman Empire\" instructed by Professor Kenneth W Harl\n\nFor more information Please visit https://www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/show/the_ottoman_empire?tn=Also+By+This+Professor_0_5"

                "description": "The French Revolution was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval in France and its colonies that lasted from 1789 until 1799. It was partially carried forward by Napoleon during the later expansion of the French Empire. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, catalyzed violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon who brought many of its principles to areas he conquered in Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history, triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies.Through the Revolutionary Wars, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video is extracted from 24 Lectures course called \n\"Turning Points in Modern History\" instructed by Professor Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius\n\nFor more information Please visit https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/turning-points-in-modern-history.html",

                    "description": "The French Revolution was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval in France and its colonies that lasted from 1789 until 1799. It was partially carried forward by Napoleon during the later expansion of the French Empire. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, catalyzed violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon who brought many of its principles to areas he conquered in Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history, triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies.Through the Revolutionary Wars, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video is extracted from 24 Lectures course called \n\"Turning Points in Modern History\" instructed by Professor Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius\n\nFor more information Please visit https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/turning-points-in-modern-history.html"

European politics became dominated by religious conflicts, with the groundwork for the epochal Thirty Years' War being laid towards the end of the century. In Italy, Luca Pacioli published the first work ever on accounting and Galileo Galilei made the first thermometer. In England, the Italian Alberico Gentili wrote the first book on public international law and divided secularism from canon law and Roman Catholic theology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video is extracted from 36 Lectures course called \n\"War, Peace, and Power: Diplomatic History of Europe, 1500-2000\" instructed by Professor Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius\n\nFor more information Please visit https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/war-peace-and-power-diplomatic-history-of-europe-1500-2000.html"

After years of preliminary exploration and military skirmishes, 180 Spanish soldiers under conquistador Francisco Pizarro, his brothers, and their native allies captured the Sapa Inca Atahualpa in the 1532 Battle of Cajamarca. It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory in 1572 and colonization of the region as the Viceroyalty of Peru.

                "description": "Prior to the rise of Muhammad and the unification of the Arab tribes of the Arabian Peninsula under Islam, the tribes of Arabia followed a pre-Islamic Arab polytheism, lived as self-governing sedentary and nomadic communities and often raided their neighbouring tribes.Following the conquests under Muhammad of the Arabian Peninsula, the region became unified and most of the tribes adopted Islam.\n\nThe first caliphate, the Rashidun Caliphate, was established immediately after Muhammad's death in 632. The four Rashidun caliphs, who directly succeeded Muhammad as leaders of the Muslim community, were chosen through shura, a process of community consultation that some consider to be an early form of Islamic democracy.The fourth caliph, Ali, who, unlike the prior three, was from the same clan as Muhammad (Banu Hashim), is considered by Shia Muslims to be the first rightful caliph and Imam after Muhammad.Ali reigned during the First Fitna (656\u2013661), a civil war between supporters of Ali and supporters of the assassinated previous caliph, Uthman, from Banu Umayya, as well as rebels in Egypt; the war led to the establishment of the Umayyad Caliphate under Muawiyah I in 661.\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video is extracted from 36 lectures  course called \"The Big History of Civilizations\" instructed by Professor Craig G.

                    "description": "Prior to the rise of Muhammad and the unification of the Arab tribes of the Arabian Peninsula under Islam, the tribes of Arabia followed a pre-Islamic Arab polytheism, lived as self-governing sedentary and nomadic communities and often raided their neighbouring tribes.Following the conquests under Muhammad of the Arabian Peninsula, the region became unified and most of the tribes adopted Islam.\n\nThe first caliphate, the Rashidun Caliphate, was established immediately after Muhammad's death in 632. The four Rashidun caliphs, who directly succeeded Muhammad as leaders of the Muslim community, were chosen through shura, a process of community consultation that some consider to be an early form of Islamic democracy.The fourth caliph, Ali, who, unlike the prior three, was from the same clan as Muhammad (Banu Hashim), is considered by Shia Muslims to be the first rightful caliph and Imam after Muhammad.Ali reigned during the First Fitna (656\u2013661), a civil war between supporters of Ali and supporters of the assassinated previous caliph, Uthman, from Banu Umayya, as well as rebels in Egypt; the war led to the establishment of the Umayyad Caliphate under Muawiyah I in 661.\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video is extracted from 36 lectures  course called \"The Big History of Civilizations\" instructed by Professor Craig G.

                "description": "Constantine the Great , also known as Constantine I or Saint Constantine, in the Orthodox Church as Saint Constantine the Great, Equal-to-the-Apostles, was a Roman Emperor of Illyrian and Greek origin from 306 to 337 AD. He was the son of Flavius Valerius Constantius, a Roman Army officer, and his consort Helena. His father became Caesar, the deputy emperor in the west, in 293 AD. Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under Emperors Diocletian and Galerius. In 305, Constantius raised himself to the rank of Augustus, senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia (Britain). Constantine was acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in 306 AD, and he emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against Emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324 AD.\n\n\nConstantinople was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine (330\u20131204 and 1261\u20131453), and also of the brief Latin (1204\u20131261), and the later Ottoman (1453\u20131923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\nThis video is extracted from 24 Lectures Course called \n\"Great Tours: Greece and Turkey, from Athens to Istanbul\" instructed by Professor John R Hale\n\nFor more information please visit \nhttps://www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/great-tours-greece-and-turkey?tn=Also+By+This+Professor_0_1",

And that means so are the resources used to produce it, which add greenhouse gas emissions.

We produce more than enough to feed everyone, but food is not distributed evenly. Shockingly, one-third of the food produced is lost or wasted. And that means so are the resources used to produce it, which add greenhouse gas emissions. Find out how you can be part of the solution.\n\nCheck out our Earth Day playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrfcruGtplwH76Sryqpk7nXf0YIEM0piZ \n\nhis video and all media incorporated herein (including text, images, and audio) are the property of the American Museum of Natural History or its licensors, all rights reserved.

It may be surprising to learn that engineers still turn to the natural world for inspiration. \n\nFor Tak-Sing Wong, a professor of engineering at The Pennsylvania State University, nature is a constant source of inspiration. In our November SciCafe, Wong introduces two cutting-edge technologies that have been directly modeled after natural phenomena. \n\nTo listen to the full SciCafe talk, including Q&A, download the Science@AMNH podcast on iTunes, Soundcloud, or wherever you get your podcasts. \n\nThis SciCafe took place on November 7, 2018.\n\nSciCafe: Engineering Technologies Inspired by Nature and related activities are generously supported by the Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\n#Bioengineering #PitcherPlant #Engineering #Technology #Biotechnology #AMNH",

It may be surprising to learn that engineers still turn to the natural world for inspiration. \n\nFor Tak-Sing Wong, a professor of engineering at The Pennsylvania State University, nature is a constant source of inspiration. In our November SciCafe, Wong introduces two cutting-edge technologies that have been directly modeled after natural phenomena. \n\nTo listen to the full SciCafe talk, including Q&A, download the Science@AMNH podcast on iTunes, Soundcloud, or wherever you get your podcasts. \n\nThis SciCafe took place on November 7, 2018.\n\nSciCafe: Engineering Technologies Inspired by Nature and related activities are generously supported by the Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\n#Bioengineering #PitcherPlant #Engineering #Technology #Biotechnology #AMNH"

Paleontologist and Curator Emeritus John Maisey explains how sharks' cartilaginous skeletons differ from those of bony fish, and why it's so hard to find complete skeletons in the fossil record.\n\n#SharkWeek #Shark #Teeth #Fossil #Bones #Teeth #Ocean #Explainer\n\n***\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/AMNHorg?s...\n\nCheck out our full video catalog:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/AMNHorg \n\nFacebook: \u202ahttp://fb.com/naturalhistory \u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\nTwitter: \u202ahttp://twitter.com/amnh \u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\nTumblr: \u202ahttp://amnhnyc.tumblr.com/\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\nInstagram: \u202ahttp://instagram.com/amnh\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\n\nThis video and all media incorporated herein (including text, images, and audio) are the property of the American Museum of Natural History or its licensors, all rights reserved.
