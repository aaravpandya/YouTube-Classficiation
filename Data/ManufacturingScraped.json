We printed date/lot codes, S/N, GTIN and data matrix codes on flat cartons. Using Adents serialization software and a Cognex vision system camera we serialized the flat cartons for efficient track and trace. We can print on plastic, pouches, leaflets, cards, CR 80, magnets, CD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and DVD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, envelopes, paper, packages/boxes, flyers, and much more.Serialization Systems manufactured by Pineberry Manufacturing Inc. are designed for complex coding and high resolution printing requirements for packaging and pharmaceutical serialization and traceability. Producing the cleanest codes on the market, verified with an in-line reader and cannot be tampered with, pharmaceutical and packaging cartons, bags and leaflets are controlled with precision providing codes and data that are superior to TIJ (thermal inkjet), DOD (drop-on-demand) or laser, with zero printing consumables or downtime. Pineberry Manufacturing Inc.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serialization and track & trace systems aim to help fight the immense market of counterfeit products and to enhance consumer safety in accordance with legislations, such as the Drug Quality & Security Act (DQSA), the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), and the EU Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD).Pineberry Manufacturing Inc.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CartonTrac SF series Serialization Friction Feeder has a small footprint measuring 36 inches long by 30 inches wide. Serialization requires a comprehensive system to track and trace the passage of packages, prescription drugs and pharmaceutical products throughout the entire distribution and supply chain. Serialization is able to identify every product\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serial number, origin, shelf life and batch number; tracing the products life cycle from production, through distribution to patient. With a reliable 1D or 2D barcode reader, pharmaceutical products and packages can be verified to ensure 100% accuracy. Pineberry manufactured its pharmaceutical and packaging serialization machinery systems so they are modular and can act as leaflet verification systems as well; saving customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from purchasing two separate machines.Our friction feeders can be used as an automated stand-alone or in-line application.

Using robotics to band and case batches together, the Pineberry CartonTrac Serialization and Aggregation System prints and applies a label to the band/case with a serial number. As the cartons are combined, the serial number of the aggregated unit (parent) is associated with the multiple serial numbers of the individual cartons (child) contained within it, thus builds a parent-child relationship as products move through the packaging stages of the pharmaceutical supply chain.Manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers and pharmaceutical supply chains inherit the most benefits facing significant packaging line upgrades to meet the current and emerging regulations compliant with the USA FDA Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). Putting aggregation in place offers operational benefits, like inventory management. With serialization, wholesalers are able to identify inventory down to a specific unit and track it internally. With aggregation, they could do that for both opened and sealed cases as well. It greatly simplifies cycle counting, which wholesalers periodically do to check their physical inventory against what their system thinks they have. Aggregation allows them to scan just the sealed case and instantly know the identities of all the individual units.Email: info@pineberryinc.comToll Free: 1-844-746-3634Tel: 1-905-829-0016http://www.pineberryinc.com",

Learn the differences between various flap discs and why they are so important to have in your shop.The first step is to remove the welds with a 60-grit flap disc. While a fiber disc will remove welds more quickly, they also have a higher chance of damaging the part \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially on thin-gauge steel like what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using here. Whether you use a type 29 or type 27 flap disc for this application depends on personal preference and your desired finish. A type 27 flap disc grinds with more force, and type 29 tends to leave a finer finish.In the second step, the Scotch-Brite\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Light Grinding and Blending Disc refines and blends the scratch left by the flap disc to get the steel part ready for paint. Since the flap disc leaves behind some discoloration and scratches, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crucial to perform this second step before applying paint.Products featured in this video: 3M\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Cubitron\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 II Flap Disc 969F (Type 29 and Type 27) - https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-u...Scotch-Brite\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Light Grinding and Blending Disc - https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-u...TJ is an employee of 3M Abrasive Systems.Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe!",

            "description": "There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than one way to bevel a workpiece. You can use a grinding wheel, a fiber disc or a flap disc, depending on personal preference. Here we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll talk about the different beveling methods and perform a material removal test: How much material does each product remove after 30 seconds of grinding? For our test we used a 1018 carbon steel plate.First up is our 3M\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Silver Depressed Center Grinding Wheel. Grinding wheels are known for their exceptional durability. While they may not cut the fastest, they will last through heavy grinding and beveling on many parts. [Material removed: 19 grams.]Next, our 3M\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Cubitron\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 II Flap Disc 969F takes a turn. While flap discs don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut the fastest, they are the most conformable and user-friendly. However, in high-pressure applications like beveling, flap discs tend to wear down quickly. [Material removed: 27 grams.]Last, but definitely not least, the 3M\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Cubitron\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 II Fibre Disc 982C. Fiber discs are the fastest-cutting among the three abrasives, removing much more material than the grinding wheel and the flap disc after 30 seconds of grinding.

            "description": "See how easy it can be to remove a weld and get a carbon steel workpiece ready for paint \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can do it in just two steps. Since carbon steel always needs to be painted, it makes sense to cut down the time to get to a paintable surface.The first step is to remove the weld. In this demonstration we used a 3M\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Cubitron\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 II Fibre Disc 982C to complete this task. As you can see, this disc grinds down welds very quickly. Be careful with how much pressure you apply when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re grinding welds on thin gauge steel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you press too hard you could dig too far into the workpiece.After the weld is taken down, a Scotch-Brite\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Light Grinding and Blending Disc is used to refine the scratch left by the more aggressive disc to blend and finish the workpiece and get it ready for paint. All that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left to do now is paint the workpiece.By combining fast-cutting 3M\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Cubitron\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 II with our non-woven Scotch-Brite\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 abrasive products, you can save time and increase productivity.Products featured in this video: 3M\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Cubitron\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 II Fibre Disc 982C - https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-u...Scotch-Brite\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Light Grinding and Blending Disc - https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-u...TJ is an employee of 3M Abrasive Systems.Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe!",

But how does that method compare to using our Scotch-Brite\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Clean and Strip XT Disc? A wire brush will eventually remove paint from a workpiece, but as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see, the Clean and Strip XT Disc is the better option.Our friend Jim Cooper was nice enough to send us an old motorcycle gas tank for our test, and our timekeeper put 10 seconds on the clock.First up is the wire brush, a common paint removal tool used on right angle grinders. After the 10 seconds, the wire brush removes the clearcoat, primer and paint, and the metal is just starting to come through.On the other hand, the Scotch-Brite\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Clean and Strip XT Disc gets down to the bare metal almost instantly.Products featured in this video:Scotch-Brite\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Clean and Strip XT Disc - https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-u...TJ is an employee of 3M Abrasive Systems.Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe!",

But the Scotch-Brite\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 disc removes the scale without damaging the workpiece.On the third substrate, a metal box with large welds, Scotch-Brite\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Clean and Strip XT removes the scale, weld spatter, heat discoloration and rust without taking down the weld. In some industries, like agriculture, a thick, visible weld is preferred. The product removes all the discoloration and impurities from the workpiece without cutting too deep into the metal or removing the weld.Products featured in this video:Scotch-Brite\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Clean and Strip XT Disc - https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-u...TJ is an employee of 3M Abrasive Systems.Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe!",
