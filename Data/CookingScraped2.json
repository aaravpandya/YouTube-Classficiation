Some of the best crabs in Sri Lanka come from Trincomalee. Much of the culture and people of Trincomalee are Tamil, and the food and culture reflects that.King of Crabs - First we went to visit the main crab dealer of Trincomalee where he pulled out some fresh crabs from the lagoon. We ended up buying 3 KG of crab - 5,500 LKR ($30.68) to bring back to the house to cook.At the house, the family had already prepared a selection of Sri Lankan Tamil food dishes, that were vibrant and ready to be eaten, but they immediately got started cooking the crab. The crab cooking was simple, but heavily relied on their own family blend of masala spice mixture.All the dishes were served over a banana leaf plate, each with its own color and vibrancy. It was an incredible meal, so much delicious food and such a variety. I loved it. It was a perfect was to spend a day learning about Sri Lankan Tamil food in Trincomalee, Sri Lanka.Thank you to everyone who generously hosted me in Trincomalee, for the delicious food, and to Ruzaina for arranging everything.

Ruzaina arranged for us to meet up with the Sri Lanka Special Forces to cook lunch and eat in their mess hall, but it turned out to be more of an adventure than just that!We arrived to the Special Forces base camp, and they were already cooking the meal for lunch. But also our plan for the day was to buy a fish and cook a big fish, so the Captain called his fisherman friend, and he had a special type of shark (which is commonly eaten in Sri Lanka) and said it was his favorite. So we ended up getting the shark to cook and share with the entire Special Forces unit. We ended up missing the main lunch, but we had lunch in the General's office instead with the delicious mix of local dishes and the addition of the shark curry. It was a privilege to have this opportunity.Sri Lankan Batticaloa food - In the evening we were invited to a local home in Batticaloa to eat a typical regional Batticaloa Sri Lankan food meal. The meat blew me away with the flavors and ingredients, and it was my first time to eat mountain knotgrass, which was delicious.Thank you to everyone who generously hosted me in Batticaloa, for the delicious food, and to Ruzaina for arranging everything.

They get started on your order, chopping everything up and mixing it with spices and sauces on the hot plate all while chopping and mixing and the same time. It truly is a spectacular food to watch being prepared and the chefs are such experts and masters at what they do.Katakat or tak-a-tak is no doubt one of the most intense, amazing, and delicious Pakistani street foods to eat in Karachi and I will be back to Noorani Kabab House everytime I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in Karachi.Big thank you for my friend Ali (https://www.instagram.com/alinhamdani/) for making this happen!Watch my entire Pakistan Food series here: https://youtu.be/Xdya8eym9nMMUSIC: https://www.audionetwork.com/ and https://goo.gl/HwVjdoCAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNfMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: https://amzn.to/2tzcKmjFOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

On our last visit to Karachi (street food tour: ) we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to eat some of the things I really wanted to try, so I was happy to be back in this massive food city in Pakistan!Biryani - In the previous episode of Pakistani street food in Karachi (you can watch it here: ), we ate biryani from a very friendly man who sets up his shop just outside Kaiser Restaurant.

Located just outside Kaiser Restaurant, go check them out!Kaiser Restaurant - One of the main things Ali and I wanted to eat last trip to Pakistan but they were closed the day we were filming and we ran out of time is Kaiser Restaurant, famous for their whole grilled mutton legs smothers in Masala. We order three of them, covered in masala and one extra spicy. The meat was incredibly delicious and the masala sauce was unbelievable. We had a great time and delicious food. Price - 1,700 PKR ($12.08) per mutton legSince we had some time in the afternoon, we stopped at the beach to walk around. At the beach we met Lion King!Geo Gola Corner - Possibly the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sweetest dessert, gola ganda is a mashup of shaved ice, ice cream, and all candy and syrups you can think of in the world. Not really for me, but it was amazing to see them make it and assemble it.Cool Inn - Chaat refers to any of the very common savory snacks common throughout the Indian subcontinent. My favorite is pani puri, and my wife Ying loves dahi puri. But here at Cool Inn which is a famous Pakistani street food chaat spot, Ali and I both loved their special chaat. Price - Around 100 PKR ($0.71) per plateAnwar Baloch Restaurant - Finally to wrap up this Pakistani street food tour in Karachi, we drove over to Anwar Baloch Restaurant known for their karahi curries.

We also ordered pretty much all the other dishes they offered, and the food was spectacular.Total price - 40 MYR ($9.81)Warisan Pahlawan Resort - But the real highlight of Malay food for the day was going to Warisan Pahlawan Resort where the Aunty is known as one of the best local food cooks in Kuala Berang. Again, she prepared for us local Malaysian food from Kuala Berang, nearly everything dish including huge amounts of fermented durian paste (tempoyak). It was a Malaysian meal of my dreams. She also wanted to cook for us a dish of bilimbi fruit, simmered with coconut milk, which was incredible.This home-cooked village meal in Terengganu was one of the best meals of this trip to Malaysia.

The rice is cooked with chicken broth like most chicken rice, but instead of just a plate of rice, you get little fish ball shaped rice balls, along with chicken. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an iconic dish, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty delicious and makes a wonderful breakfast.Total price - 29 MYR ($7.12)Asam Pedas Pak Man - Asam pedas is sour spicy, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find variations of it across much of Southeast Asia, but Melaka is quite famous for it within Malaysia. We went to Asam Pedas Pak Man, a stall set up within a local Malaysian food court. I ordered a variety of different plates, each asam pedas but with a different fish. All were spectacular. It looks extremely spicy, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not actually all that spicy, however it is extremely tasty and full of herbs and chilies and flavor. Best Malaysian food dish of the day in Melaka for me.Total price - 75 MYR ($18.39)Klebang Original Coconut Shake - This was pretty ordinary for me, nothing spectacular, but again it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of those things most people try in Melaka.Total price - 9.90 MYR ($2.43)Ban Lee Siang Satay Celup - Next up, satay celup, a unique Melaka style satay where you choose your own skewers and boil them in the sauce right in the middle of your table. For me honestly, satay celup is too sweet, but I have to admit it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of fun to eat and cook, and very social.Total price - 34 MYR ($8.34)Ikan Bakar Haji Masu - Finally to end this Malaysian food tour in Melaka (Malacca), we went to a seafood, ikan bakar (grilled fish) restaurant. There are quite a few huge seafood restaurants in Melaka, but I wanted one that was kind of small and laid back. Ikan Bakar Haji Masu was fantastic, and I think the best thing was their grilled fish.Total price - 99 MYR ($24.27)Thank you for watching this Malaysian food tour in Melaka.

Mr. Annuar is an amazing hard working man who has been selling his south Indian Muslim style fish head curry for a long time and has a loyal following. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also known for his affordable prices and his fried chicken. The staff were all incredible nice, and their fish head was amazing. I also especially loved the fried chicken with the fish head curry sauce on top. Mr. Annuar would not charge us for our meal, thank you!Tugu View Cafe: https://goo.gl/maps/uvSfgwf3qssNext we went to Tugu View Cafe, an amazing local Malay food restaurant on top of a hill in the middle of Kuala Lumpur, although it felt like you were in the middle of a mountain park. They serve all sorts of Malaysian food, but their most famous dish is their Malay style fish head curry. We met the chef of the curry, and I just asked him to choose us the largest size which happened to be a 120 RM fish head! Most of the others were 45 - 65 RM! This was probably the best fish head curry for me of this entire Malaysian food fish head curry tour. The complexity of flavor and the ingredients blew me away.Total price - 144 RM ($35)Restoran Mun Kee Steam Fish Head: https://goo.gl/maps/X5dbhmdBTKK2Finally to end this fish head curry tour, we went to a Chinese restaurant. So this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually a fish head curry, but a steamed Chinese style fish head. They gave us not only the head, but really the entire body minus the tail. It was delicious, perfectly steamed with wonderfully fragrant ginger, and it was a perfect fish to end the meal with.Total price - 98 RM ($23.80)This was an amazing fish head curry Malaysian food tour in Kuala Lumpur!MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdoCAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!",

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truly a breakfast of meat loving champions, but it is filling and heavy, and so good. Javed Nihari is one of the best places in Karachi to eat nihari.Total price - 1,150 PKR ($8.42)Burns Road - We continued on to Burns Road, one of the legendary street food streets in Karachi. It was a Sunday morning and there were elections happening, so Burns road wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually that busy. But we did find a few delicious things to try.Arabian paratha - The Arabian paratha, or mataba, or any other names it has across Asia is a stuffed roti. In this case he filled it with chicken and spices and egg before wrapping it up and shallow frying it. It was delicious.Price - 120 PKR ($0.88)Matka kulfi - Also on Burns Road is a maka kulfi shop where they sell Pakistani ice cream in little clay cups.

Most of the time its prepared with organs, but this was with fish, and it was again one of the best dishes I ate in Pakistan. An amazing combination of fish, spices, and chutney.Landhi Dairy Colony - Next we headed to the biggest buffalo colony in Asia, maybe the world. Over 700,000 - 800,000 cattle and livestock live within this area that is within Karachi, Pakistan. It was fascinating to visit and drink the freshest buffalo milk possible.Dua Restaurant - Finally for dinner we finished this Karachi street food tour at Dua Restaurant, a huge restaurant serving grilled meat and karahis.

At 16,010 feet in elevation, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty high, and you start to feel a little dizzy.Before getting to Khunjerab Pass, we first stopped at Attabad Lake, a spectacular lake in the mountains, a result of an earthquake that changed the course of the mountains causing a dam along the Hunza River. Boat ride and tea was amazing.We continued driving and stopped in Sost, Pakistan, to eat a quick lunch, which happened to be my first vegetarian meal in Pakistan - including dal, beans, and mixed vegetables, all of which were delicious. Another couple of hours later, passing herds of yak and flocks of sheep and goats, we finally made it to Khunjerab Pass. It was cold, freezing cold, and the elevation was so high that if you just walk for a little while you start to lose your breath. But the views and location were otherworldly. From Khunjerab Pass we drove down to Gulmit Village, known for having a populations of Pamiri people, and therefore Pamiri food. Although similar to the food we had in Hunza Valley, it was also quite different, but again very unique, refreshing, healthy and wholesome, using lots of whole grains, nuts, and local produce.It was my first time to ever eat Pamiri food and to learn just a little about Pamiri culture and people.Another amazing day in Pakistan.

I combined the two days because things didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work out as planned on Day 9, and so didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end up being able to film much. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the way things go sometimes!So firstly, on Day 9, the plan was to drive from Shigar to to Deosai National Park, and drive all the way through the park to the other side, en-route to Gilgit. Unfortunately it started snowing along the way, and by the time we arrived to the entrance of the park, it was snowing too hard, and it was too risky to proceed. So we turned around and took the long way to Gilgit.Gilgit, Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan - Ok, so now back to today (Day 10) we started the morning with a street food tour of Gilgit. Gilgit is an amazing small town, sort of the gateway of Gilgit Baltistan, and a commerce hub for the region on the Karakoram highway. The town is extremely friendly, and everywhere we went to eat on this small market and street food tour, we were greeted with such friendliness and hospitality.Kabuli pulao - 140 PKR ($1.04)Grilled meat - 120 PKR ($0.89)Curry - 120 PKR ($0.89)After about an hour eating street food and walking around the market, we continued on to Nizam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house, which was about a 15 minute drive from the center of Gilgit. Nizam is an employee of Ali, and he graciously invited us to his amazing home in the countryside. The view from the backyard was breathtaking.We first went to the river valley to pick vegetables where we met Nizam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father in law, who again may be the happiest man on earth - he was amazing pounding the chilies. We picked vegetables, and just stood in amazement at the natural wonder beauty of Pakistan. Lunch was incredibly delicious, all the fresh vegetables we picked, plus both mutton and beef curry, with rice and roti. The curries were some of the best I ate in Pakistan, but the fresh mountain vegetables, sauteed down with dried tomato, were the highlight. An incredible meal, really one of the most memorable I had in my entire trip to Pakistan.Thank you Nizam and family for the amazing meal!Watch the entire Pakistani video series: https://youtu.be/Xdya8eym9nMAli: https://goo.gl/VY6NjHJoel: https://goo.gl/5AkWm6MUSIC: https://us.audionetwork.com/Logo: https://goo.gl/VhaLp5CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: @migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!",

Thank you Waqas and Peshawar for an amazing street food tour!Halwa puri - We started off this Peshawar street food tour with first breakfast, halwa puri, something that is loved throughout Pakistan. Their version was one of the best, fried in pure desi ghee, and what I loved most was the chana, chickpeas stew.Nika Seri Pai - Breakfast number two was one of the best dishes I ate in all of Pakistan - Peshawari seri paye, this version made with stewed cows feet. The stew was so rich and incredibly thick - like one of the most rich things you could possibly eat. What I loved so much about Peshawari paye is that it had an incredible garlic flavor. The meat was fall apart tender melting as well.Price - 500 PKR ($3.73) per bowlSir Cunningham Clock Tower - After breakfast we headed to walk around and explore Peshawar, which has some ancient history, and is a fascinating city to explore.

Everything was incredibly good, and I especially loved the lamb chops.Total price - 2,600 PKR ($19.38)An amazing day in Peshawar, it was one of those days where everything is fascinating, everywhere you look and everything you taste.Thank you again to Waqas for taking us around: https://goo.gl/ipRiqeAli: https://goo.gl/VY6NjHJoel: https://goo.gl/5AkWm6MUSIC: https://us.audionetwork.com/Logo: https://goo.gl/VhaLp5CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!",

This was my first time to try this Pakistani food speciality, and I was blown away with every bite. Chapli kebabs are extraordinary!Islamabad - Capital Pakistan - So we started off the day in Islamabad, but the plan for the day was to drive to Mardan, eat along the way, and eat our way through Mardan, but mostly focusing the day on chapli kebabs.Mian Jee Restaurant - One the way to Mardan we stopped at Mian Jee, a very famous restaurant know for all sorts of dishes, but especially their world famous dal. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so thick and creamy it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost the consistency of peanut butter. And yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rich and delicious.Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan - We arrived in Mardan in the early afternoon and headed straight to eat chapli kebabs for the first time.Chapli Kebab - Mardan - The first place we are chapli kebab was a local favorite spot in Mardan city. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not exactly sure of the name, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very popular spot and known by locals. They had the massive podium fryer, filled with melted fat, and made medium sized burger patties, with big chunks of bone marrow to make this even better. Their chapli kebabs (kababs) were seasoned perfectly with a balance of tomato and cumin. It was an eye opener for me.Falooda - Next we stopped in Mardan to eat falooda, and from what I understand, Mardan falooda is pretty famous.River View Restaurant - Next on this day of Mardan and Peshawar, we drove to River View Restaurant, mainly to go on a boat ride in the Kabul River. The river ride was fun, and it was amazing to be cruising down the Kabul river. The restaurant also had delicious food.Rambail Chapli Kebab, Taru Jabba - But for our real dinner we needed to get another dose of chapli kebabs. On the way, almost to Peshawar city, we stopped at Rambail Chapli Kebab, Taru Jabba, possibly the most famous of all chapli kebab in the world. And when you see their bonfire and podium of a cooking station, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best. They make larger sized patties, filled with spices, and bone marrow, and again fried in their own fat.The chapli kebabs were so unbelievably delicious, I could hardly control myself. It was an amazing day of Pakistani street food in Pakistan, and an intro to chapli kebabs from the source.Ali: https://goo.gl/VY6NjHJoel: https://goo.gl/5AkWm6MUSIC: https://us.audionetwork.com/Logo: https://goo.gl/VhaLp5CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!",

But before leaving Lahore, we stopped to eat what is one of the most beloved of all dishes in Pakistan: nihari.Waris Nihari (Read the blog post: https://migrationology.com/nihari-lah...) - There are a number of famous places to eat nihari when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Lahore, but we tried Waris Nihari, tucked deep within a narrow alley. Nihari is a meat stew, and when you order, he dishes you out some meat, some of the brown stew, and finishes it off with a some desi ghee. They heated up some more desi ghee and poured it on top to complete. The best thing about nihari is that you can season it yourself with chilies, ginger, and lime juice. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the kings of Pakistani food!Price - 500 PKR ($3.82) per dishGrand Trunk Road - Full from a serious meat breakfast, we continued driving towards Gujranwala taking the famous Grand Trunk Road, what is one of the oldest roads and trade routes in Central Asia.Pakora - After arriving in Gujranwala we stopped to eat some pakoras, a massive display of deep fried snacks. They were dangerously tasty.Camel kebabs - 140 PKR ($1.05) - In the market, while walking around we saw a man selling small camel kebab sliders and we immediately had to taste them. They were incredibly delicious, seasoned with plenty of coriander seeds.Pakistani wrestling with Inam Butt - Wrestling is an ancient sport in Pakistan and we were invited to watch a practice along with world champion wrestler Inam Butt. It was an honor to be there and a lot of fun. Khizar Tikka Shop - For dinner we had a chance to experience of the greatest Pakistani food displays, the gigantic grill at Khizar Tikka Shop in Gujranwala. Their grill and entire kitchen set-up is impressively giant, and their food is incredibly good.

In this video we went on a Pakistani street food tour of the Walled City of Lahore, one of the oldest and most fascinating areas of the city. The Walled City is a maze of ancient alley, street food, and markets that never seem to end. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the best places in Lahore to explore and go on a food tour.Phajja Siri Paye - This restaurant is a must eat when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Lahore, famous for serving a dish called paya - goat trotters stew. Their massive pan, which I believe never stops bubbling or cooking, is packed full of goat feet trotters that slow simmer until fall apart tender. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a deliciously thick and meaty Pakistani dish to start your morning.Total price - 1,300 PKR ($9.70)Haleem - During my time in Lahore, haleem was probably the most surprisingly delicious dish I encountered. I honestly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was going to be much, but sprinkled with boiling desi ghee, and seasoned with spices and herbs, it was truly incredible - so good I had to have a plate re-full. He wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge us, thank you!Wazir Khan MosqueDahi bhalay - 100 PKR ($0.75) - Next on this street food tour of the Walled City of Lahore, we came across a stall selling dahi bhalay, yogurt marinated lentil puffs. It was delicious and refreshing.Chole bhature - 30 PKR ($0.22) - Next to the dahi bhalay was chole bhature, a dish of stewed chickpeas, seasoned with onions and achar pickle.Fruit chaat - One of the best Pakistani snacks of the day was the fruit chaat, a massive bowl of chopped fruit, seasoned with apricot chutney and pomegranate. A\\gain, he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge us, thank you!Dhaba restaurant - Finally to finish this food tour, for a late lunch we went to a local dhaba, a local street side restaurant, that served a mix of Pakistani food. It was here I came across the fastest roti maker I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen and we ordered a mix of different curries to share. After a delicious meal, we ended with dude pathi, pure milk tea.Total price - 850 PKR ($6.34)Badshahi Mosque - After our late lunch, we headed over to Lahore Fort and Badshahi Mosque, two of the most significant and historical sites of Lahore.It was an amazing day exploring and eating through Lahore, a city that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s packed culture, history, friendly people, and delicious food.Again, massive thank you to Ali, from Pakistan Travel Mart for hosting us in Pakistan, taking us around, and organizing everything.

Hamzaev - Head of Marketing and Promotion of Uzbekistan Tourism. Check out Bekruz: https://goo.gl/M14aZWRavshan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLf...Uzbekistan Day 1: TashkentOn Day 1 in Uzbekistan we went on an ultimate Uzbek street food tour in Tashkent, including the biggest bazaar in the city, and the most massive plov (rice pilau) cooking in Tashkent.We had arrived at the airport in Tashkent at about 4 am in the morning, and at 9 am we were ready to start eating our way through the city. First we met up with Bekruz and Akbar both from the Ministry of Tourism Uzbekistan (Bekruz is the one who invited me to Uzbekistan and arranged everything for us, so thank you Bekruz!), and Ravshan (check out his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLf...), a local food vlogger in Uzbekistan.Two of the most important phrases you should know in Uzbek are:Assalomu Alaykum - Hello / GreetingRahmat - Thank youBread Bazaar, Tashkent - We started this ultimate street food tour at the bread bazaar in Tashkent, a market dedicated fully to bread, with a little fruit and other things mixed in. We bought some break, some kaymak, and some fruit and then went to a nearby restaurant where they laid everything on the table for us, along with tea. Uzbek breakfast was a great way to get started.Chorsu Bazaar - The grandest bazaar in Tashkent is Chorus Bazaar, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a perfect place to get a feel of Uzbek culture and food. We first stopped at the food court to try hanum, a type of dumpling filled with potato and somsa. Then we continued to the dome shaped iconic part of the bazaar, filled with fresh meat and spices. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the coolest market structures anywhere in the world.Plov Center - We kind of had to rush out of Chorsu Bazaar because although they prepare 1,500 Kilos, seriously, of rice plov per day, it only takes 2 - 3 hours before they run out everyday. So we got there, already one of the monster swimming pool pans was finished, but they still had a few others going and serving. Plov is the national dish of Uzbekistan, a food that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eaten on every and all occasions. For Tashkent plov, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty heavy on the meat at oil, with rice, chickpeas, and raisins. Also it included, qazi - horsemeat sausage which is a delicacy. It was incredibly delicious, and proper meal experience.Total price - 100,000 UZS ($12.21)Plov is love, remember that when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Uzbekistan.National Food Restaurant - After strolling around for a while in the afternoon, we continued to a National Food restaurant, a laid back family style restaurant that serves all things Uzbek food. Along with a number of dishes, the main dish I was most interested in was the naryn, thin slices of dough mixed with minced meat and horse. It was interesting, and quite good, as were the other dishes.Total price - 110,000 UZS ($13.43)Sultan Suleyman Restaurant - For dinner we went to a bit of a fancy trendy restaurant, and had another platter of food. This time, dough noodle like sheets topped with meat, horse sausage again, and green onions.Total price - 122,000 UZS ($14.90)It was a day of learning, eating, and meeting some amazing people along the way.

We set off to eat some amazing food in LA area including tacos, Armenian kabobs and Chinese savory pies.Featured in this video, and huge thanks to:Liz Johnson: https://www.instagram.com/__lizjohnson/Will Aghajanian: https://www.instagram.com/waghajanian/Teddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Red Tacos: https://www.instagram.com/teddysredta...Armin from Mini Kabob: https://www.instagram.com/eatbearded/Jeffrey: https://www.instagram.com/jeffrey_mer...Barbara: https://www.instagram.com/barbara_pol...Teddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Red Tacos - The first place we ate on this best of Los Angeles food tour is Teddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Red Tacos. First of all, Teddy is such a friendly down to earth guy who is passionate about birria, one of my favorite Mexican foods. Serving out of a food truck, we ordered the mixed plate of birria tacos, his made with beef. It was extraordinary, and great to hang out and meet Teddy as well.Mixed plate - $10Beijing Pie House - Next we drove East to the Beijing Pie House, another one of Liz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best favorite restaurants in LA. We ordered a mix of dishes including a variety of dumplings and the highlight was their tripe salad laced in Sichuan pepper oil. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for some Northern Chinese dishes, Beijing Pie House is well worth the drive from Central LA.Total price - $55.70Mini Kabob - There was one more huge meal we had to eat on this best restaurants in LA food tour. We drove to Glendale where there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a large population of Armenians, and we met up with Armin, son of the owner of Mini Kabob. Immediately I loved the place, family run, just a small little shop with a few tables, and an ultimately friendly place. They welcomed us in and Armin took care of us from the start, fixing us a mixed meat platter with a little bit of everything. The Armenian kabobs were spectacular, as were all the different salads.Huge platter - thanks Armin!Heroic Deli - Finally, to end this restaurants tour of LA, we drove over to meet my friend Jeffrey who is starting a deli in LA called Heroic Deli (https://www.heroicdeli.com/). Barbara prepared us their signature OMG classic Italian sub, which was unbelievably good and well balanced. When they open in Santa Monica, be sure to stop by for a fantastic sandwich.Thank you to Liz and Will for taking me around to some of their favorite restaurants in LA, I had an amazing time!MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

Jeffrey made sure to call Gilberto himself to reserve some of the meat dripping dynamite sticks to make sure we had some. The dynamite sticks are essentially stewed lamb, cooked until fall apart tender and dripping with oil. In order to make them he dunked a tortilla into the hot oil, sizzled it on the hot plate, filled it with the fall apart tender meat, and rolled it up into a taquito. The result was spectacular. Everything else was delicious too, but the dynamite sticks were crazily good.Total price - $35 for everythingBirrieria Guadalajara - Next we drove a little further towards Riverside, California, to eat birria, a special Mexican goat stew. Again, this is another Mexican food that just melts in your mouth, meat cooked until fall apart tender. It was spectacular and all the staff were very friendly as well.Total price - $32 for everythingMitla Cafe - Right across the street from Birrieria Guadalajara you will find Mitla Cafe, home to the original crunchy American taco. An American taco is a crunchy shell, ground beef, iceberg lettuce, yellow cheese, and tame salsa. As the true story goes, Glen Bell was selling food across the street and used to come to Mitla Cafe to eat their amazing crunchy tacos. Eventually he got the owner to show him how to make the crunchy tacos, and he later started the entire taco bell empire. The downside is that he never admitted that he got the idea and recipe from Mitla Cafe. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to see Mitla Cafe is still doing very well, and their crunchy American tacos are fantastic.Price - $13.95Taco Bell - Yes, just for comparison purposes, we had to go to the nearly Taco Bell. It had been years since I had last eaten taco bell. I have to admit the crunchy tacos were decent, but the crunchwrap supreme doritos locos thing we order, nope. That just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it for me.Mariscos Jalisco - Finally to end this Mexican street food tour of LA, we headed to Mariscos Jalisco, a legendary seafood truck serving their famous shrimp tostadas and the Poseidon. They were delicious in every dimension, and it was the perfect ending to this full day of amazing Mexican food in LA.Total price - $13 for everythingThank you for watching this LA food video!MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

Also check  out his food lists at: https://www.xtremefoodies.com/LA is known for its Korean food, and if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one legendary LA Korean food dish you need to eat, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the giant galbi jjim, a cauldron of bubbling Korean chili and shortribs meat, all swimming in rice sticks, and melted cheese. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an amazing dish. I met up with my friend Jeffrey to not only eat at the most famous restaurant for this dish, but to eat at the other place next door as well. Sun Nong Dan (https://goo.gl/maps/i6xeX2rNqv32) - This is the original restaurant in LA serving galbi jjim, and one of the best things about them is that they are open 24 hours. We arrived at 8 am to start this Koreatown food tour. We ordered the large size and the extreme spicy version. It comes to your table in all glory, full to the brim with bright red chili stew and slices of short rib meat and  a massive handful of shredded cheese. When they bring it to your table, they bust out the blowtorch and melt all the cheese in front of you.Price - $64.99But as the story goes, Jeffrey was confused the first 4 times he ate galbi jjim and accidentally went to the restaurant next door to eat this dish, a restaurant that serves a similar dish, but is always much less busy. So naturally after finishing at Sun Nong  Dan, we had to go and eat next door to try their version of meaty chili pot.Yangji Gamjatang (https://goo.gl/maps/M6FhiztThJG2) - We stepped inside and ordered almost the same thing. At Yangji Gamjatang they served it over a hot burner so it boiled throughout our entire meal. I noticed immediately that they chili sauce was a little less sweet and had a nice sesame aroma to it. The meat was also much different, even a different cut from Sun Nong Dang, it was more brisket-y, with strands of meat falling off the bone. Again we ordered the large size with cheese.Price - $45.95So which one was better? You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to watch the video to find out!In any case, it was just an incredibly Koreatown galbi jjim food tour in LA, that was as fun as it was delicious!MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

Of course, they do serve it at restaurants in Addis Ababa, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing like seeing the entire process of a dish, especially a stew like doro wat from start to finish, beginning with a chicken, and finishing by eating. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very complicated dish to make, and it takes utmost care and time. I want to say a huge thank you to Belaneh and his family for graciously inviting us to their home and for cooking the most amazing doro wat - or even Ethiopian food meal - ever.What is doro wat (\u00e1\u2039\u00b6\u00e1\u02c6\u00ae \u00e1\u2039\u02c6\u00e1\u0152\u00a5)? Doro means chicken and wat means stew - so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an Ethiopian chicken stew. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very special dish to eat in Ethiopia, not an everyday food because it takes so much time to prepare properly. As many Ethiopians told me, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dish they often eat when family comes together, and during special holidays and religious days. I would go as far as saying Doro Wat is one of the best dishes in the world. The complexity yet harmony of spices, the richness, the contrast of taste when paired with injera - your taste buds will be blown off your tongue! Thank you to Bela and his incredible family, they took no shortcuts on making doro wat, and beyond the delicious food, it was so extremely special to get to know them and hang out with them.We first went to the fresh wet market in Addis Ababa to buy a chicken, the live chicken. We then gathered a few more ingredients, including the chopped red onions, which is the main component of doro wat sauce, and went back to Bela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home. Butchering a chicken in Ethiopian, due to some of the Ethiopian Orthodox traditions, needs to be butchered in a certain way, and washed and cleaned many times. It was by far the most cleansed chicken I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen or eaten. The onions simmered for a few hours before we started adding in the berbere blend spice and finally the chicken went in to brew with the amazing spices. To eat Ethiopian food, you first typically build a plate or platter of injera, and then scoop the food onto the injera. We all shared a platter and scooped on the beautiful doro wat. It was unbelievably delicious, so rich and packed with spice.Again, thank you to Bela and his wife (and baby) for cooking us one of the most special meals you can eat in Ethiopia.Hotel I stayed at in Addis Ababa: https://www.booking.com/hotel/et/zeis...MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

Ethiopia is one of my favorite countries in the world for food and travel, and this was my second time to visit, and I was eager to explore and eat as much as possible.We started early, 5 am in the morning and Go Addis Tours picked me up to start at the wholesale market. Even though the city is still sleeping, Addis Mercato is buzzing from 3 am when trucks full of produce from all over Ethiopia, sell them at the market in Addis Ababa. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find all the ingredients, and massive amounts, that you need to cooking Ethiopian food. It was a good warm up, to get to know some of the ingredients, before starting the day eating Ethiopian food.We had coffee, and breakfast, both of which were excellent. Later after visiting another market, Dessie took me to his neighborhood to eat shiro wat, one of the greatest of all Ethiopian foods, a thick and rich chickpea stew. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had shiro wat many times before, but never have I seen it fully prepared right in front of me. The shiro was incredibly good, piled onto a bed of injera, and we also ordered fir fir, a mashup of injera, simmered with tomato sauce and berbere.Next we headed to a fish restaurant in Addis Ababa. Ethiopia is landlocked, so all fish is freshwater. We ordered fried fish, and asa lebleb, a mixture of fish sauteed with spices and herbs. Both were excellent, but the asa lebleb was the highlight because it was so flavorful.Next Ethiopian food meal we went to one of the longtime classic restaurants to eat one of the best platters of beyaynetu in Addis Ababa. Beyaynetu is a mix of vegetarian dishes. It was again, a delicious meal, I especially love the tomato salad there.For our final meal of the day, and to finish off this extreme Ethiopian food tour, we went to one of the most well known and best quality meat restaurants in Addis Ababa to eat tere siga - raw meat. You are served a variety of chunks of raw beef, delicately sliced. Then you slice it into bite sized pieces on your own, wrap in injera, and dip into chili sauce before taking a bite. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s awesome. The fried meat version is also very good.This was an amazing day, and an amazing Ethiopian food tour in Addis Ababa.

The lake is incredible, surrounded by lush green mountains. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a perfect place in Rwanda to spend some time relaxing, learning about the culture, and eating. One of the main Rwandan foods to eat at Lake Kivu is sambaza, a fish similar to sardines.To begin this food and cultural tour of Gisenyi, Lake Kivu, we first stopped off at the local market, and took a boat ride. They were not allowed to fish on that day to control the fishing, but the fishermen gave us a quick lesson on how they fish, and took us out on a boat just to show us. It was one of the highlights of the day for me. The fishing boats are so peaceful and the rowing songs were amazing.After having a quick snack of some deep fried sambaza, which were delicious, we continued on to one of the biggest fresh markets in Gisenyi. We saw ladies pounding cassava leaves, and stopped to eat some fruit. The tree tomatoes in Rwanda by the way are delicious.Ibyiwacu Restaurant - Next we ate a quick Rwandan food lunch at a local restaurant. Buffets are very common in Rwanda, you choose all your different starches, with beans, and a couple of different sauces, and you can choose if you want meat or without meal. Overall, very good and fresh food, a little plain, but good with some extra chili sauce.Price - 1,500 RWF ($1.70) per personNext we headed to a local home for a home cooked African meal, including some of the local ingredients commonly used in the culture around Lake Kivu. Sambaza are a staple, but since we already had some fried, they made a peanut (groundnut) stew with the fish, and also made some vegetable dishes, with rice, and a number of other starches. The sambaza with peanut sauce was the BEST meal of my entire trip to Rwanda.Thanks to Yves from Everywhere Travel Tours: yvesbernardin@gmail.comHotel I stayed at in Gisenyi (amazing place, affiliate link): https://www.booking.com/hotel/rw/para...MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",

The only thing that can be a bit hectic is when all the meat stalls are all trying to get your business at once. Some of the vendors even fight each other for your business.

I was excited to sample authentic Ashanti food, and to spend just a short time exploring Kumasi. The drive from Cape Coast took about 4 hours.Fufu for Lunch - When we arrived, we were all quite hungry and so we stopped at a local chop bar (Ghanaian local food restaurant) for lunch. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not really sure of the name of this spot, or I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even think it really had a name written on it.

The leaves were boiled and ground with garlic and spices, then doused in boiling palm nut oil to finish it. The dish was served with boiled green plantains and cocoyams that you could dip into the kontomire stew.

And while there some types of bushmeat that are not good or unsafe to eat - grasscutter - also known as a greater cane rat, is safe and one of the most popular types of bushmeat to eat in West Africa. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a delicacy!So while we were driving on our way to Elmina, Ghana, along the side of the highway, we stopped at some hunters, and bought a grasscutter. Later in the day, we met up with our host family, and we drove over to the Elmina fishing market. The market was amazing, bright and colorful, and energetic, with some unique fish and seafood available from the Atlantic. We bought some fish to go along with our grasscutter, and then we continued back to the house to start cooking.First for lunch, Mama made us a dish called Eto, a mash up of yam and palm nut oil, topped with eggs. It was a little on the dry side for me, but it was an honor to have a chance to try that special Ghanaian dish.For dinner we prepared the fish and grasscutter. The fish was made into Ghanaian groundnut or peanut soup, which is one of the best dishes I at in Ghana. The grasscutter was made into a bushmeat grasscutter light soup which included chilies, garlic, onions, ginger, and tomato.Finally, for the main start of the meal Mama made omo tuo, Ghana style rice balls.How does grasscutter taste? The greater cane rats run around the fields and eat grass, so unsurprisingly some parts kind of taste like grass. But they are a white meat, and have a similar look to chicken, but the meat is even sweeter. It was also surprisingly fall apart tender. I thought it was amazing!Across West African food, grasscutter is a very popular meat, and a delicacy eaten on special occasions.MUSIC: https://artlist.io/***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/",

Just to make it clear, I did not pay for this meal, but all opinions and thoughts in the video are my own.The House on Sathorn - First of all, the House on Sathorn is one of the most beautiful preserved historical mansions in all of Bangkok, part of the W Hotel, and situated in the heart of the downtown financial district of Bangkok. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an amazing location and a gorgeous restored building that dates back to 1889. The Dining Room is the signature restaurant, which was listed as one of Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 50 Best restaurants.Chef Fatih Tutak - Eating at The Dining Room was a chance to meet and interact with the amazing head Chef Fatih Tutak, originally from Turkey, but with experience cooking in some of the most renowned restaurants in the world throughout Asia and Europe. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fascinating chef, and as soon as you meet him, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know that his knowledge of food and passion is what shines. He was quick to tell me, he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t serve fusion food, but Innovative Turkish cuisine.I ate their signature journey, a tasting omakase meal, all a progression of Turkish cuisine, but you could definitely tell the Chef used some Japanese techniques, included most notably in the presentation and sushi bar counter seating.The combination of the unique and creatives dishes, plus the amazing atmosphere, and Chef Fatih Tutak explaining each dish and the story behind it, all added up to make it one of the most memorable fine dining meals I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had in Bangkok.

So we set off on a 2 day excursion, into the mountains, not too far from Luang Prabang. The first day we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d spend learning about the Khmu culture and eating local authentic Khmu food. The next day, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d move onto a Hmong village to eat Hmong food.We met up with Alex and his team from White Elephant Adventures (http://www.white-elephant-adventures-...). This is not sponsored, I paid in full for this tour, but Alex and his team were gracious to really set us up with a custom tour about food and culture. I highly recommend them for off the beaten path, authentic culture tours in Luang Prabang. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too long of a drive, and we stopped at a variety of markets along the way, but we eventually made it to the Khmu village. It happened to be the village of our guide. It was a gorgeous village, by the river. For lunch we had some simple bamboo shoot mixtures wrapped in banana leaf and steamed. Khmu mainly eat sticky rice.After lunch we walked around, took a swim in the river, and just hung out, waiting for the dinner festivities.We purposefully didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really make too much of a plan, because we wanted to just see what unfolded naturally at the village. They decided to butcher a small pig for the village and for the evening festivities. They also planned a baci ceremony - a Laos ceremony of blessing, which was an amazing experience and left me feeling so incredibly welcome.Anyway, after the afternoon swim, the men got started butchering the pig and parting off each piece of meat - serious nose to tail dining - to the person who was designated to cook each different dish. What was amazing to me is that everyone in the community had a role, and each worked diligently for the greater community. There were so many different local Khmu Lao foods being prepared that I could hardly keep up. But one of the most interesting dishes for me was the or lam, a well know Lao Khmu dish, but this version unlike anything I had tried before. One of the single most amazing ingredient is spicy chili wood - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually a vine that grows in the jungle, and it is really spicy and makes your tongue tingle.The baci ceremony was spectacular, the meal of all things pig with the community was special, and at the end of the night the children from the village sang us a couple of songs.It was a fantastic day, delicious authentic and fresh Lao Khmu food, and an incredible time to learn about Khmu culture, and interact with the community.Thank you for watching!10 Best Things to Do in Luang Prabang: https://migrationology.com/things-to-...MUSIC: All Around https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/",

It was formerly a series of pre-Hispanic villages along Lake Xochimilco. Eventually Mexico City expanded and grew all the way to Xochimilco, and now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the boroughs of the city.What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most remarkable about Xochimilco, and the reason most people go to visit is because of the extensive network of canals that form the framework of the area. Nowadays, you can rent the brightly colored boats and take a ride, eating and drinking along the way. I was there on a weekend evening, and it was a bit more rowdy and loud than I had wanted it to be, but it was still very fun. If you go during the daytime, you might have a more peaceful relaxing journey at Xochimilco.Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Lalo (https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo) and I did on our short visit:Mercado de Xochimilco - This is the main market of Xochimilco, and one of the best places to get started eating traditional Mexican food when you visit Xochimilco. At the entrance of the market you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find rows of vendors selling home-cooked foods. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss them, they are incredible delicious. Along with rare types of tlayudas, the highlight for me was the chicken tostada which blew me away.Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the list of everything we ate, but really you can just walk around, see what looks good, and try it:Tlacoyo - 12 MXN ($0.65) eachTostada - 15 MXN ($0.81) eachTaco - 5 MXN ($0.27) eachJamaica - 10 MXN ($0.54)Carnitas - 20 MXN ($1.08) eachAfter eating, we walked over to the boat pier. And unfortunately we were running a little late on time and it was a race against time and daylight, but we made it to the pier. Lalo talked to the boat crews, and we finally arranged a boat. The cost was a little higher than what it would normally be for locals, but unfortunately, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what it came down to.Boat hire - 850 MXN ($45.91)Hope you enjoyed this tour of Xochimilco. The colorful boats are impressive to see, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to believe you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Mexico City when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re both at the relaxed Xochimilco Market, and gliding along the canals.Thanks again to Lalo for coming along.

Oaxaca has one of the most developed and advanced food cultures in all of Mexico. For our first day, we set out on a Mexican street food tour of Oaxaca, eating everything we could see.Mercado de Abastos - We began the morning at one of the biggest local fresh food markets in Oaxaca. I samples a Tamal de Mole - 11 MXN ($0.59) and a hot Chocolate - 10 MXN ($0.53), both of which were delicious, and a great way to start this tour.Soup - 30 MXN ($1.60) per bowl - The market was just opening, but there was a busy soup stall, so we stopped to have a bowl. The fish and shrimp soup were both delicious.Memelas - 30 MXN ($1.60) total - One of the ultimate Mexican street foods to try in Oaxaca is memalas, a round of masa, cooked and topped with salsa and cheese, and your choice of other toppings. We got it with grilled meat on top. It was delicious, one of the best things I ate throughout the day.Carnitas - 30 MXN ($1.60) total - This was just a quick impulse taco on the go because it looked so good\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it was.Z\u00c3\u00b3calo Oaxaca, Plaza de Santo Domingo - The center of Oaxaca is a pleasant place to hang out, only today there happen to be a protest going on, so it was a bit busy.Mercado 20 de Noviembre - Meat combo - 300 MXN ($16.02) - This is one of the great meat halls of the world. You walk in to the meat sauna, choose your meat, they grill it all in front of you, and you eat it with tortillas and salsa. An amazing food paradise.Tlayudas El Negro - Tlayudas are another common Oaxacan street food, using giant tortillas filled with beans, cabbage, and cheese, and then grilled. Price - 80 MXN ($4.27) for 1Monte Alb\u00c3\u00a1n - Resting our stomachs, we did a little sightseeing in Oaxaca. One of the famous attractions are the ruins of Monte Alban. Elote - 20 MXN ($1.07) - You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find elotes, a corn on the cobb with cheese and salsas, all over Mexico. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the most common Mexican street foods\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but this guy is at the main plaza of Oaxaca is on another level. His style is champion!Mole negro - 60 MXN ($3.20) per plate - Finally to end this Mexican street food tour of Oaxaca, we needed to have a plate of mole negro, one of the national dishes of Oaxaca.It was an amazing day of food. Oaxaca has such a rich culture of food and friendly people.MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/",

I met Carlos many years ago in University in Phoenix, Arizona, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s originally from Sonora, in Northern Mexico. Throughout University, Carlos and I would eat Mexican food non-stop,  and we dreamed of traveling in Mexico to experience more. Finally we made this trip happen!We actually flew into Cancun, and then immediately drove down to Playa Del Carmen where we based ourselves. On our first day we decided to take a day trip to Tulum, a small town on the Riviera Maya coast, and one of the official historical port cities of the Maya.Taquer\u00c3\u00ada Honorio - First things first, we started off with some breakfast tacos at a well known  Mexican street food spot in Tulum. I had a mix of four different types of tacos, all of which were extraordinary, but probably the best was the lechon, the roast suckling pig. This is a  must eat tacos restaurant when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Tulum.Price for my plate - 64 MXN ($3.45)Ruins of Tulum - 70 MXN ($3.77) - One of the main attractions in Tulum are the ancient Mayan ruins. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a beautiful place, and what makes it so incredible are not only the ruins, but the fact that they are right up along the gorgeous turquoise Caribbean coast. It was great to walk around, even though it was packed with visitors. Playa Paraiso - Next we drove over to Playa Paraiso, just down the beach from the Ruins of Tulum, which crystal sparkling water.Chamico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s - By lunchtime we were all very hungry, so we drove over to a place called Chamico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a spot I had searched out on Google maps. Just from the photos it looked like a place I needed to go, from the relaxing atmosphere to the amazing fresh seafood. It was just as good as I had imagined. The restaurant was right along the beach, breezy, and the Mexican food was amazing. We had a few plates of ceviche, fried fish, and a shrimp cocktail.Total price (for 4) - 1,180 MXN ($63.53)Tulum, Mexico, is a true beach paradise, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an amazing place to visit in Mexico.

My brother in law Derek had already been to Little Miss BBQ, but it was my first time to eat here, and I was so excited.I arrived a little over an hour early to get in line, but luckily as soon as you pull up you get a number so that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually have to wait in line the entire time. Scott and the entire crew at Little Miss BBQ are amazing, and you can immediately feel their passion and their genuine love for what they do and for the people they get to interact with everyday as a result of serving the best BBQ in Phoenix! Scott and his wife have an interesting and amazing grassroots history and start to their BBQ business. They first started making BBQ at home just because they loved doing it. Eventually they started competing in American BBQ competitions. At the beginning things didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go so well, but they kept going and perfecting their BBQ recipes and eventually started to win some of the competitions. Eventually they opened Little Miss BBQ, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the best BBQ spots you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ever eat at.So after getting the full tour of the restaurant and all the smoked meat, it was about time to open. You line up outside and the actual inside is quite small - most people either takeaway or eat outside.I wanted to try a little of everything, so we got a giant tray of smoked BBQ meat including pork ribs, pulled pork, turkey, sausage, brisket, and beef ribs, with sides. Total price for the entire tray came to $92.70 - that was a lot of meat!Thanks to my brother in law Derek for coming out to eat as well. We started with the beef ribs, and those are the best of the best. The meat falls apart and it was so insanely juicy and flavorful. The BBQ brisket will also blow you mind with its massive meaty flavor and juiciness. Finally my other top meat was the sausage, including jalapeno and a mix of meat and bacon.Lastly, you have to eat your American food bbq feast with their famous pecan pie. And even though I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not into sweets, a few bites at the end was amazing.Little Miss BBQ is a phenomenal BBQ restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona. Not only will the quality and taste of the meat blow you away, but the passion of Scott and the entire crew are so genuine and so friendly, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what makes it so good.Thank you for watching this BBQ video!MUSIC: Turn on my Swag -  https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/",

Leave a comment now!\u00e2\u2013\u00baSUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe\u00e2\u2013\u00baT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Phoenix, ArizonaI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve eaten In-N-Out Burger before and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve eaten Five Guys before\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but this was my first time to ever eat them back to back. In this video I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m taking you on a full burger review comparison between In-N-Out and Five Guys, two burger chains with extremely loyal followings.In-N-Out BurgerI ordered the Double Double and extra crispy fries. Now to keep things consistent for the review, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go all crazy with their secret menu of toppings, so all I ordered was extra onions.Prices - Double Double - $3.85, Extra crispy fries - $1.80The Double Double from In-N-Out is indeed extremely tasty and salty and it has an amazing balance of tastes and everything goes together in such harmony. However, after finishing the Double Double I walked away still quite hungry.Five GuysNext we drove over to Five Guys, luckily just a 5 minute drive from In-N-Out Burger. Again, I kept it pretty simple and just ordered their cheeseburger all the way, and a side of regular fries. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll notice immediately that the prices are twice as high as In-N-Out, however, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out that their burger weight probably twice as much as well.Prices - Cheeseburger - $7.99, Fries - $4.29The Five Guys Cheeseburger is heavy and dense, and they already press down the bun for you, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fluffy at all. The ingredients inside are great, and I especially enjoyed the mushrooms inside. The burger is definitely not as salty as In-N-Out, however it tastes better quality.VERDICT:It sort of depends on what mood you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in, and you do have to take into account that Five Guys is twice as expensive as In-N-Out - so you could eat two Double Doubles for the same price as one Five Guys cheeseburger.I think the In-N-Out Double Double is tastier, possibly because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saltier, but the Five Guys burger tastes fresher, more natural, and a little more home-cooked styles. Overall, I would choose Five Guys more often than In-N-Out Burger. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my final verdict.What about you?

I paid for this tour, but they did a great job and I would recommend them.Kunming, Yunnan, China - Kunming is the capital and largest city in Yunnan province China. So I was excited to explore the local market in Kunming and eat as much street food as possible!Here are all the Chinese street food dishes we ate throughout the market:Rice pudding - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was slightly fermented, and sweet, like a rice alcohol pudding. It was pretty good, but quite sweet, so I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat that much of it.Dumpling - 1 RMB ($0.15) - I saw these dumplings sizzling and hissing and there was no way I could walk by without trying one. Stuffed inside were leek and egg. They were a little on the oily side, but delicious.Whole duck - 20 RMB ($3.03) - Yunnan is famous for roast duck, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a version that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comparable even to Beijing style. Style I was excited to find a stall that at the market that specialize in Yunnanese roast duck. It was delicious and the owners were very friendly as well.Pickled pears - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was an interesting snack, and supposed to be very healthy and good for digestion. Drink - 2 RMB ($0.30) - This drink was incredible sweet, but refreshing.Tofu Noodles - 5.5 RMB ($0.83) - Another extremely popular Chinese street food snack at the market was tofu noodles - I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had tofu and noodles, but not really mixed before. It was a little plain and starchy, but from all the sauces, it was taty.Rice balls - 5 RMB ($0.76) - We also tried sesame rice balls which were delicious.Jacuzzi braised \u00c2\u00bd chicken - 15 RMB ($2.27) - This was one of the highlights of the market for me, mainly because the owner was so friendly and his giant jacuzzi of boiling chickens was amazing to see! The chicken was a little bony, but flavorful.Yellow soybean porridge - 3.5 RMB ($0.53) - As we were leaving the market, we stopped for one last bowl of soybean porridge to eat with youtiau, Chinese donuts. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting to like it as much as I did, but it was delicious. It was very warming and hearty.Finally to complete this Chinese street food tour in Kunming, Jerry and I, along with his family ate Chinese Yunnanese bbq.

I was immediately blown away by the palace grounds, the beauty of the architecture and the lush greenery of Bali.After walking around for a while, and getting dressed in a local Balinese sarong, it was time to get started. The chef at the Palace is an insane cook, and cooks so fast and so expertly, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amazing to watch him.We started cooking an Indonesian food Balinese feast including some of the best Balinese dishes like sate lilit, tum ayam Balin, lawar, ares soup, and be lindung.

This is video is not sponsored, but I did get free tickets to these attractions.Another amazing day in Dubai - we started by visiting the Burj Khalifa, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tallest building for an incredible view of the city. We then enjoyed an amazing authentic Emirati food lunch at Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding, and finished the day with a falconry show and dinner.Burj Khalifa, At The Top -  It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty incredible, like a needle that rises from the sand into the clouds. This is one of those attractions you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t visit Dubai without doing and the view is mind blowing. I only wish it would have been a little more clear outside for an even better view.Ticket prices - 125 - 200 AED ($34.02 - $54.44)Bosporus Restaurant - At the  Dubai Mall, I was randomly invited by some viewers who watch our videos to have a quick cup of tea and some baklava. Thank you to everyone at Bosporus Restaurant!Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding - This is really a cool place, an attraction in Dubai where you can enjoy seriously good authentic Emirati food, dress in local clothing, and you can ask whatever you like about UAE culture and traditions. In my opinion this is one of the best cultural and  food things you can do when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Dubai, well worth it. The machboos was the best Emirati food served for lunch, it was amazing!Wild Flight, Falconry show and dinner - Finally for dinner, we attended an event by Wild Flight that included a Dubai falconry show and dinner. The food was alright, not amazing, but seeing the falcons and owls was pretty cool. This would be a great thing to do as a family in Dubai.

He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home.One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice environment.Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s awesome.Price - 6 AED ($1.63) eachMachboos - Finally at Peyman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE.

But even better than their hummus for me, I loved their musabaha, raw tahini with whole chickpeas. Total price - 60 ILS ($16.76)Prickly pear - Oddly, prickly pear which is originally from SW United States is very popular across Israel. The fruit vendor peeled me a prickly pear, which is full of seeds, but pretty good.Turkish burekas - One of the popular street food snacks at Ramla Market is Turkish burekas, a snack that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also common throughout the Balkans. They were really amazingly good, a perfect salty cheesy snack. Price - 5 ILS ($1.40) per pieceNaji Iraqi Restaurant - This is one of the highlights of the market for me, a family run Iraqi Jewish food restaurant. David explained to me that Iraqi Jewish food is so hard to  find at restaurants because most people only make the dishes at home. There were definitely some dishes that I had never tried before, and it was an amazing meal.

It is not sponsored in anyway. However, after spending time with Osama and seeing the tours and great people that are involved with http://visitpalestine.ps/ I would highly recommend it.I had really wanted to visit Bethlehem, and we decided to book a tour to also visit Hebron, another one of the most religiously significant cities in the West Bank, Palestine. So we drove through the checkpoint and I could hardly believe I was in Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus.After meeting up with Osama, who is an absolutely awesome guy, we started walking off through the Old City of Bethlehem. First stop was a place to get a nice view overlooking the city. Absolutely stunning and to think of the immense and important history was mind blowing. Manakish or manaeesh is an Arabic baked flatbread, sometimes covered in za\u00e2\u20ac\u2122atar before being baked. We stopped at an breadshop to have a piece before heading on to the church.Church of the NativityNOTE: Thanks to baby Micah, we were allowed to enter a side entrance to the Grotto with no queue, which saved a  lot of time, sometimes you have to wait for an hour to get entrance because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very small.Being a Christian, this was an experience that was almost surreal and extraordinarily special for me. I will cherish that entire moment in the Grotto, a place that marks the spot where Jesus was born and where he was laid in a manger.Walled off hotel - We then took a drive over to the Walled Off Hotel, a hotel that faces the separation wall. It was eye-opening to learn more about the situation.Palestinian food home cooked - There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no better way to eat when you travel than to have home cooked food. And so through the arrangement of Visit Palestine, we were invited to a Palestinian family home to eat an Arabic food feast that included chicken stuffed with rice and meat all baked in oven safe bags (I think). The chicken and the spices were amazing, and additionally the side dishes, including the freshly roasted almonds were the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had. Also, the hospitality and generosity of this family in Bethlehem truly made it memorable. It was an honor to enjoy Palestinian food in Bethlehem with a local family. Hebron Old City - We continued on to Hebron, a city about 30 minutes from Bethlehem. Again it was a fascinating and eye-opening ride. Hebron is a city known for its conflict.Ibrahimi Mosque (also known as Cave of the Patriarchs) - At the Ibrahimi mosque you can pay respect to the tombs of Abraham, Isaac, Sarah, and Leah. Again, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty surreal to visit, and it a truly special moment.Fresh juice - 5 ILS ($1.40) - We then walked around the streets of Old City Hebron, which to be honest is a little scary and unfortunately filled with tension. Even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so beautiful and so ancient, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eerie.It was a fascinating experience to visit Palestine, eye-opening as well. But the combination of generous people I met, delicous Palestinian food at a family home, and seeing in person the place where Jesus was born and where Abraham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tomb sits, all added up to be one of the most special and emotional days I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had in my life.Just as a note of reference: I paid $500 USD for the tour with http://visitpalestine.ps/, but they provide transportation for me and my family from Tel Aviv, and it included everything private. I also needed a  private tour to be able to make a video like this.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the most fascinating cities in the world, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a city that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve wanted to visit my entire life.

We then toured around Old Jerusalem, and enjoyed some incredible Palestinian food kebabs cooked by an incredible man who cooked with serious love and passion. Another highlight in Jerusalem was the mutabak, a thin  pastry stuffed with cheese and baked.After eating our way through Old Jerusalem, we then headed into West Jerusalem and went to lunch at an Israeli Jewish restaurant serving a mix of amazing dishes. The food was home-cooked in style, and absolutely sensation. A few more snacks and sightseeing throughout the afternoon, and that brought us all the way to dinner where David had made reservations to eat at one of the hottest restaurants in Jerusalem, Machneyuda Restaurant.

We only had a few hours, so I wanted to make the most of eating Austrian food for the time we had. We also were able to walk around Salzburg and visit some famous attractions during the day.Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the list of Austrian food I ate during a one day trip to Salzburg, Austria:1. Cafe Am Kai - Cafe Am Kai is a nice trendy cafe along the river with great views. I ordered a kleiner brauner, a type of Austrian style coffee and an apple strudel. Total price - 14.40 EUR for 3 of us2. B\u00c3\u00a4renwirt Restaurant - This is a restaurant that serves fantastic home-style Austrian food in Salzburg.

Finally I had to try the Austrian k\u00c3\u00a4sesp\u00c3\u00a4tzle an extremely warming and cheesey pasta dish. Price - 33.90 EUR 3. Balkan Grill Walter - Balkan Grill is known to serve the best bosna sausage, a type of Austrian food sausage that originates from Salzburg.

Augustiner Br\u00c3\u00a4u Kloster M\u00c3\u00bclln - There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt Augustiner Br\u00c3\u00a4u Kloster M\u00c3\u00bclln is the best of the best, an institution beer garden and hall in Salzburg.

There are other markets like Central Market and Russian Market, but Orussey Market tops them all. One morning we headed off on a Cambodian street food tour of Orussey Market. I first wanted to explore the outside area of the market. One of the most popular stall we came across was actually serving pho, famous as a Vietnamese noodle soup. The crowd eating there and the aroma of the broth forced us into sitting down to have a bowl and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappoint. The beef pho was excellent, one of the best bowls I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had in a very long time. Pho - 8,000 KHR ($1.93) per bowl Inside Orussey Market you will find just about everything in Cambodia that you can think of, from clothes to food to accessories, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all in the market somewhere. We headed to the food court area, but there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot going on, so we decided to just have a cup of iced coffee. My hopes for lunch were on a Khmer rice and curry feast, and so we kept walking around the market, until we stumbled into a prepared curry dishes stall that had an amazing array of different Cambodian dishes. It was a love at first street food kind of place. We proceeded to order a huge Cambodian street food curry feast and it was one of the best Khmer meals I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even begin to tell you the names of all the different dishes, but the prahok, a paste made with fermented fish sauce, was excellent. Total price for entire Khmer curry meal - 50,000 KHR ($12.09) On the outside of Orussey Market you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find lots of Cambodian street food snacks. I was pretty full honestly after that curry meal, so I just had a bag of candied and pickled bright colorful fruits. They were topped in a sugary chili salty coating, and though a little sweet for me, they were pretty awesome. Fruit bag - 3,000 KHR ($0.73) If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a food lover in Phnom Penh, take a trip to Orussey Market for some amazing local Cambodian food and culture! -- Music in this video: Cause I Am Coming Home https://goo.gl/HwVjdo  MY CAMERA GEAR:Main camera: http://amzn.to/2dEL3hvMain lens: http://amzn.to/2e5Lum62nd camera: http://amzn.to/2mczuDx2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2mcEGauMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2dEr9Z9Gorillapod: http://amzn.to/2epFsQx*These are Amazon affiliate links I would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology T-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/ -- \u00e2\u2013\u00baSubscribe to my channel for more videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe",

Mang Tootz Food House is a famous Philippines food restaurant in Manila, located in the heart of the city next to University of Santo Tomas. Because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next to a major university, it attracts quite a crowd of hungry students everyday, along with anyone else passing by and ready to eat a delicious Filipino food meal and some of the best banana egg rolls (turon) you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ever try. Mang Tootz Food House is a carinderia, a local style eatery, and to eat you go up to the front of the restaurant and pick and choose the different dishes you want to try. I got a plate of Bicol express, inihaw na liempo, sisig, chicken kebab, ginataang langka, and finally, their banana rhuma, which is what they call their version of banana egg rolls, or banana lumpia, or turon. Out of the Filipino dishes I ordered, the Bicol express, a Filipino stew of pork with coconut milk and chilies, and the ginataang langka, a jackfruit stew with coconut milk, were my favorite dishes of the meal. The chicken kebab wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t my favorite dish as it was covered in a mayonnaise tasting sauce. Banana-rhuma (turon) - Ok finally, when you eat at Mang Tootz Food House, the one sure thing you have to order is their banana rhuma. These little banana egg rolls are amazing, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see them at the front of the restaurant being made and deep friend. Many people come by in the afternoon and order only the banana egg rolls, just as a snack to go. They take a lumpia wrapper, place a piece of banana on the inside, wrap it up, and deep fry it in a wok to a crispy golden crunch. The banana egg rolls are then stir fried with a caramel like mixture,and sprinkled with sesame seeds. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a big sweets lover, but when Filipino turon are hot and fresh, they are truly amazing, and these were the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever tried.

She loves to eat, and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just an awesome person!Quezon City is a city next to Manila, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually a bigger city than Manila, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of Manila. So for this Filipino street food tour, I met up with my great friend Reby, who is from Quezon City, and we hit the streets to find some incredibly delicious food. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s everywhere we went and the dishes that we ate.University of the Philippines Diliman - The University of the Philippines is known throughout Manila for its street food stalls, mainly because lots of students gather on campus to enjoy delicious food and hang out.Rodic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Diner - Tapsilog - 95 PHP ($1.91) - We began at Rodic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Diner a legendary diner at University of Philippines and tried their legendary tapsilog. This is a well known Filipino food dish that includes cured carabao (water buffalo) meat, topped over rice, with a fried egg on top as well. It makes a great breakfast dish, and it was a great way to start the day off with. Outside of the student center, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find some other Filipino street food carts selling snacks like cheese ice cream (20 PHP ($0.40) and cheese corn (20 PHP ($0.40).Mang Larry's Isawan (Isaw - 60 PHP ($1.21) total) - Probaby the most famous street food at University of Philippines in Quezon City is Mang Larry's Isawan, a stall that serves grilled skewers of mostly pig and chicken intestines. The intestines and nice and clean, and grilled over hot fire, before you get them. When you get your skewers, you dip them in vinegar, or more like drown them in vinegar, and eat. They were truly incredible, like little bites of hollow crunchy sausage.Lagro Market - Continuing our Filipino street food tour of Quezon City, Reby brought us to a local market called Lagro Market. As soon as we arrived I noticed one of the coolest rotisserie chicken street food carts that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen, and we had to make a stop and try some of their chicken (lechon manok (roast chicken). The chicken was alright, a little dry, but tasty, and the setting and atmosphere, plus the chicken street food cart, was very cool. Half chicken - 85 PHP ($1.71).Buko (30 PHP ($0.60) - Buko is the word for young coconut, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing more refreshing than a young coconut on the streets of Manila.Mango shrimp paste (7 PHP ($0.14) per piece) - Although this is a humble easy Filipino street food snack, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of my favorites. A sour green mango is cut, then topped with spicy shrimp paste and you eat it like a caramel apple. Marawi, Mindanao, Philippines Food - We ended this Filipino food tour by going to a random street food stall that we came across, located across the street from the market. The little stall was serving a type of cuisine from Marawi, located on the Southern Philippines island of Mindanao. It was also Halal food, and they had a variety of typical Filipino food dishes like adobo, but also some Filipino dishes I had never tried before due to the regional differences. Although it looks simple and humble, Reby, Ying and I, all thought the food was fantastic. These are the type of street food stalls that I love to eat at most! Total price - 230 PHP ($4.62)Thank you again to Reby for showing us around and for the delicious Filipino food tour of Quezon City!--Camera gear I use:Main camera: http://amzn.to/2dEL3hvMain lens: http://amzn.to/2e5Lum62nd camera: http://amzn.to/2mczuDx2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2mcEGauMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2dEr9Z9Gorillapod: http://amzn.to/2epFsQx*These are Amazon affiliate linksI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/--Subscribe to my channel for more delicious food videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe",

If you love to eat, when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Manila, Quiapo Market is one of the best places to start and get a feel for the city and eat some amazing Filipino street food.We started right at Quiapo Church and it happened to be a Sunday afternoon - Anton mentioned that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usually the busiest on Sunday afternoon, catering to everyone that attends the hourly church service. We walked down one alley and ate two noodle dishes palabok (20 PHP, $0.40) and sotanghon (30 PHP, $0.60). Both dishes were good, and served fresh. I especially enjoyed the sotanghon, a cellophane noodles dish, that was cooked in flavorful oil and it was a perfect slurping dish.Right in front of Quiapo Church in Manila, we at first though they were fish balls or squid balls, but they turned out to be chicken balls (2 PHP, $0.04 per ball). In order to eat Filipino chicken balls, you grab a stick, poke some on your stick, and dip in vinegar. They weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best quality, but they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expensive either. Next to the chicken balls, I saw the dried squid (10 PHP, $0.20 per stick) and had to try it as well. It was amazing, dried chewy squid, roasted over charcoal and dunked in chili vinegar.We then walked across the main road at Quiapo and found a Filipino street food stall serving all types of kwek kwek (3 for 12 PHP, $0.24). Kwek kwek is a popular street food of quail eggs, coated in a thick batter and deep fried. We also tried 1 day old fried chickens (10 PHP, $0.20), which is another popular Filipino street food in that area of Manila. As with other Filipino snacks, you garnish with chilies, shallots, and lots of vinegar before eating.Probably one of the most famous of all Philippines street food is balut (15 PHP, $.030), a duck egg embryo - like a half developed egg. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find balut all over the Philippines and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s especially popular to eat in the evening. The first thing you do is crack the top of the egg shell and drink the chicken soup. You then peel the rest of the egg, and eat both chick and the yolk on the inside. I also seasoned with a little salt and chili vinegar. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve eaten balut quite a few times during many trips to the Philippines, and I quite enjoy eating balut!Quiapo Market is a wonderful place in Manila to explore all the street food snacks available, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just an amazingly vibrant and colorful part of Manila, and it was great to hang out with Anton!Thank you for watching!--Camera gear I use:Main camera: http://amzn.to/2dEL3hvMain lens: http://amzn.to/2e5Lum62nd camera: http://amzn.to/2mczuDx2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2mcEGauMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2dEr9Z9Gorillapod: http://amzn.to/2epFsQx*These are Amazon affiliate linksI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/--Check out Anton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/antondiazSubscribe to my channel for more food videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe",

Every Bhutanese makes their own version of ezay, using a selection of different ingredients. Not two ezays are the same. At Aum Leki Wangmo Farmhouse, the mother there made some amazing Bhutanese chili sauce and I had a chance to watch her make it. Dry chilies, oil, sichuan pepper, tree tomato, ginger, salt, and cheese were a few of the main ingredients she added to her recipe.Kuenphen Restaurant - On the drive from Punakha to Phobjikha Valley, we stopped for lunch along the bumpy and beautiful road. We ordered shakam datshi, sikam datshi and chilly chicken. The food was alright, but not as good at the home cooked Bhutanese food at home stays in Bhutan. Total price - 640 BTN ($9.60)Phobjikha Valley - Phobjikha Valley is one of the most beautiful places to visit when you travel to Bhutan. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a secluded valley, high in the mountains. We checked into Pasang Zangmo Farmstay. The aunty and her family here were awesome, and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known for her cooking throughout all of Phobjikha Valley.

The main thing I wanted to eat was at the famous Xi'an Famous Foods for their spicy cumin lamb noodles. But we also enjoyed some incredible dumplings and a rack of cumin coated lamb. It was incredible.00:22 Journey to Flushing, Queens - The first part of the day was to take the train from Manhattan out to Queens, and more specifically to Flushing.

Xi'an Famous Foods was one of the top places I wanted to eat in NYC. At the bottom of the shopping center there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice food court, and it really does feel like you transport yourself from NYC to China. I ordered the spicy cumin lamb noodles and an extra side of spicy cucumber salad.

The chili oil and the cumin was just absolutely superb.

They were absolutely awesome, fall apart tender lamb, crispy on the edges and just coated in toasted crispy cumin seeds. Although some people say the quality of the Muslim Chinese lamb chops at Fu Run has gone down, I thought they were still absolutely superb.

We started off the day with an amazing Catalan food meal at Can Vilar\u00c3\u00b3 before doing some sightseeing, eating legendary Barcelona tapas, and finishing with some of the most famous Antoni Gaud\u00c3\u00ad attractions in Barcelona.00:32 Catalan Food at Can Vilar\u00c3\u00b3 Restaurant - Can Vilar\u00c3\u00b3 is an amazing and classic restaurant in Barcelona that specializes in local Catalan food. To begin our meal, I started with a bowl of gazpacho, a cold and refreshing tomato and vegetable soup. One of the main dishes I ordered was cap i pota, a Spanish Catalan dish of trip and other organs in kind of like a stew. Finally, seeing some roasted lamb cheeks, I decided to try a few of those as well. It was a delicious meal with friendly local service. Thanks to http://culinarybackstreets.com/ for this recommendation! Total price - 23.10 EUR9:16 Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya - After stopping by the Magic Fountain of Montju\u00c3\u00afc for a while, we then continued on up the thill to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. If you love art, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll enjoy this museum in Barcelona. Price - 12 EUR12:30 Montju\u00c3\u00afc Castle - 5 EUR per person - One of the greatest attractions in Barcelona is the Montju\u00c3\u00afc Castle. The castle itself is not incredible, but the views of Barcelona that you get and the perspective you can get of the city is what I think really makes the attraction worth visiting.14:42 Legendary tapas at Quimet & Quimet - After walking down from the castle, Ying and I stopped off at Quimet & Quimet, a legendary small tapas bar in Barcelona that specializes in tapas made from pickled and canned seafood and ingredients. The owner is an expert at what he does, and you can see the passion and love he has for the tapas he prepared. The best tapa I had at Quimet & Quimet was canned mussels with caviar which came topped over a piece of crispy toast. Total price - 20 EUR19:26 Casa Mil\u00c3\u00a0 (La Pedrera) - 20.50 EUR - Some of the most famous attractions in Barcelona are buildings and basilicas designed by Antoni Gaud\u00c3\u00ad. So on this day I decided to visit two of the most famous Antoni Gaud\u00c3\u00ad complexes in a row (the day before we had already visited Sagrada Familia, you can watch that here: https://goo.gl/HsORjX). Casa Mil\u00c3\u00a0 was very interesting to see and walk around and learn about Antoni Gaud\u00c3\u00ad.24:06 Casa Batll\u00c3\u00b3 - 22.50 EUR - Next, we walked down the street to Casa Batll\u00c3\u00b3, another well known building re-designed by Antoni Gaud\u00c3\u00ad. It was busier than Casa Mil\u00c3\u00a0, but it was also very fascinating to learn about the ideas, thoughts, and designs that went into the construction.On Day 22 we did quite a bit of sightseeing of attractions in Barcelona, and the highlight of the day for me was the first Catalan food meal at Can Vilar\u00c3\u00b3 Restaurant.Disclaimer and Thank You: Thank you to Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets (http://www.staralliance.com/en/round-...) for sponsoring my business class flights.

We started by visiting a couple of well known Swedish food halls, and then ate some more delicious Swedish food. It was an amazing day of visiting Stockholm!00:25 Swedish breakfast at Courtyard Marriott - The Courtyard Marriott hotel in Stockholm had an impressive display of breakfast foods including plenty of Swedish food in the buffet as well. So we started off the day with breakfast at our hotel before starting off.5:03 H\u00c3\u00b6torgshallen Food Hall - After walking around Stockholm for a while and fully enjoying the views of the city and the water, we made our way over to H\u00c3\u00b6torgshallen Food Hall, one of the Swedish food destinations on this Stockholm food tour day. After contemplating what to eat for a while, I settled on eating at a place called Melanders Fisk that specializes in seafood. Ying had the poached salmon and I had a the dill cured salmon (gravad lax). It was impressively good, the salmon was melt in your mouth tender and it was served with a side of potatoes as well. I also had toast skagen which are shrimp over toast. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of my favorite Swedish foods. Total price - 370 SEK ($43.32)12:32 \u00c3\u2013stermalmshallen Food Hall - Another legendary food hall in Stockholm is the gourmet \u00c3\u2013stermalmshallen Food Hall. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been around since 1888, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing renovation on the original market for the last couple years, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a temporary market for now. The market has a lot of similar restaurants and gourmet food stalls as H\u00c3\u00b6torgshallen, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no shortage of amazing looking food. After walking around for a while, since we had just eaten, I chose to buy some moose sausage, which was pretty good.15:49 \u00c3\u2013stermalms Korvspecialist - Next stop on this Stockholm food tour is \u00c3\u2013stermalms Korvspecialist which is just a short walk from \u00c3\u2013stermalmshallen Food Hall and they specializes in marevelous sausages. I ordered the kabanoss, a spicy sausage filled into a baguette and seasoned with mustard and sauerkraut. It was a truly delicious sausage, I loved it. Kabanoss - 60 SEK ($7.02)18:36 Gamla Stan - Gamla Stan is Old Stockholm and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s filled with narrow medieval lanes, shops and restaurants, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a great place to walk around and explore. We stopped at the German Church and I just enjoyed the atmosphere and just walking around on foot.21:44 Nystekt Str\u00c3\u00b6mming - When I asked you where to eat in Stockholm, one of the top places I was recommended over and over was Nystekt Str\u00c3\u00b6mming, a food stall that specializes in serving Baltic herries. They serve fresh herring, not the notorious Swedish fermented herring. I ordered str\u00c3\u00b6mming on rye which came with deep fried herring, mustard, onions, and dill on top. It was awesomely delicious. By this time on this Stockholm food tour day I was getting pretty full. Str\u00c3\u00b6mming - 40 SEK ($4.68)So we ended the day here. It was a wonderful day in Stockholm eating lots of delicious food!Disclaimer and Thank You: Thank you to Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets (http://www.staralliance.com/en/round-...) for sponsoring my business class flights.

From there we took the ferry across the Bosphorus to Kadik\u00c3\u00b6y, where we had an incredible Turkish seafood meal for lunch. Finally, we enjoyed some Turkish ice cream, and the show, and had the most incredible kebab I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had in my life at Z\u00c3\u00bcbeyir Ocakba\u00c5\u0178\u00c4\u00b1 Restaurant. It was an amazing day of Turkish food in Istanbul!1:27 Turkish breakfast at \u00c3\u2021akmak Kahvalt\u00c4\u00b1 Salonu - For breakfast we headed to Be\u00c5\u0178ikta\u00c5\u0178, one of my favorite areas of Istanbul, and went to a restaurant known for serving breakfast. The breakfast was amazing, and I ate a dish of eggs with beef and butter. The side dishes were also fantastic. Total price - 29 TL ($9.73)7:40 Boat to Kadik\u00c3\u00b6y and Kadik\u00c3\u00b6y Market - During our trip so far to Istanbul, we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had a chance to go to the Asian side of Istanbul. So today, we took the ferry over to Kadik\u00c3\u00b6y pier on the Asian side across the Bosphorus. The views of Istanbul from the Bosphorus were stunning. On the other side, the main thing I wanted to do was explore Kadik\u00c3\u00b6y Market, which was every bit as colorful as I had imagined. The fresh vegetables and seafood were fantastic, and I tried a cup of pickle juice.1 Week Ago in Mumbai: https://goo.gl/mK6rGs12:45 Seafood lunch at Bal\u00c4\u00b1k\u00c3\u00a7\u00c4\u00b1 Lokantas\u00c4\u00b1 Restaurant - Of all the meals I ate in Istanbul, this was one of my personal favorites, being a seafood lover. Not a far walk from the market, we went to a local family run seafood restaurant called Bal\u00c4\u00b1k\u00c3\u00a7\u00c4\u00b1 Lokantas\u00c4\u00b1 Restaurant. The owners were really friendly, and I ordered a plate of hamsi (which are anchovies), and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure of the name of the other dish, but I got Black Sea salmon braised in olive oil and butter I think with herbs and spices. It was one of the best Turkish foods I ate the entire trip to Istanbul. Wow, it was amazing.20:50 Turkish Ice Cream - After spending some time exploring the Asian side of Istanbul, we took the ferry back to the European side, and since Istiklal Street was on our route, we stopped to have Turkish ice cream. You also see Turkish ice cream vendors playing with their customers, but when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the victim, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so confusing and funny. They have some serious skills playing with Turkish ice cream. Do you like Turkish ice cream?23:49 Z\u00c3\u00bcbeyir Ocakba\u00c5\u0178\u00c4\u00b1 Restaurant - For our final Turkish food meal of the day, we headed over to Z\u00c3\u00bcbeyir Ocakba\u00c5\u0178\u00c4\u00b1 Restaurant. Ocakba\u00c5\u0178\u00c4\u00b1 is a type of Turkish grill, and they served all sorts of different meat included kebabs and lamb chops in particular. We also got a bunch of side dishes and they cooked the kebabs and lamb chops right in front of us within the center of the restaurant. The kebab was the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had in my mouth, with an amazing mixture of minced meat and spices. Total price - 100 TL ($33.55).

And the read highlight of the day for me was the incredible Turkish food, especially the kebabs.Museum Pass Istanbul - 85 TRY ($28.88) - Before getting started with the things we did in this video, I purchased a Museum Pass for Istanbul, which granted me access to a few of the attractions without having to stand in line. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if I really saved much money, but it did save time.2:00 Sultan Ahmet Camii (Blue Mosque) - Our first stop of the day in this attractions in Istanbul video was the Sultan Ahmet Camii, which is commonly known as the Blue Mosque due to its blue tiles on the inside. We actually arrived a little too early in the morning, so they were not open yet, so we walked around the Hippodrome of Constantinople for a few minutes. When the Blue Mosque opened, we went inside. Both inside and outside are incredible to see.5:37 Hagia Sophia - One of the most famous pieces of architecture in all of Istanbul and one of the most famous attractions is Hagia Sophia. It started off as a church, later became a mosque, and now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an official museum. After entering, you can walk around the main room, but the highlight of visiting Hagia Sophia for me was walking up to the upper galleries for some amazing views from above. 8:24 Topkapi Palace - Finally, one more of the most famous attractions in Istanbul, and located right in the same area as Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque is Topkapi Palace, which was an Ottoman Palace. You can walk around the gardens and palace structures, which are now galleries. I especially enjoyed the Imperial Harem, which was a section of the palace reserved for women, and the best preserved area of the palace.11:25 Sehzade Erzurum Cag Kebab (\u00c5\u017eehzade Ca\u00c4\u0178 Kebap) - There are many different types of Turkish food, and cag kebab is a type of kebab from Erzurum in Eastern Turkey. According some some men I met while eating the amazing kebabs, this is the best restaurant for cag kebab in all of Istanbul. The type of kebab is made from lamb, and instead of being on a vertical skewer like other types of kebabs, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grilled on a horizontal skewer. The meat is cooked with wood fire, and slice off onto smaller skewers to be served. If you get a chance to try cag kebab, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an absolutely stunning Turkish food. The entire meal was delicious, but the best part was meeting the owner of Sehzade Erzurum Cag Kebab and eating a slice of the meat right off the roll hot and fresh. Out entire meal cost 85 TL ($28.88).20:34 Basilica Cistern - 20 TRY ($6.80) - Arter the amazing Turkish food lunch, we headed over to see the Basilica cistern, one of many underground cisterns in Istanbul. It was interesting to see. We then headed to the hotel for a rest, and then went out again for dinner.23:27 Dinner at Balkan Lokantasi - Be\u00c5\u0178ikta\u00c5\u0178 is a neighborhood in Istanbul and we walked over to a restaurant for dinner in that neighborhood called Balkan Lokantasi. It was an extremely busy restaurant serving all sorts of different Turkish food in a cafeteria like style. You walk through the line, choose whatever dishes you want, and pay for what you get. You can eat a serious feast for a pretty good price. I got a little confused and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really know what I was doing, so ended up ordering what was way too much food. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alright, it was all really delicious.It was fantastic day of Turkish food and visiting some attractions in Istanbul that I had wanted to visit my entire life.Music:https://www.audionetwork.com/browse/m...https://www.audionetwork.com/browse/m...Disclaimer and Thank You: This trip was made possible by Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets (http://www.staralliance.com/en/round-...) who sponsored my business class flights.

I ordered a kofte sandwich, and after toasting the bread, he added in a bunch of little meat kofte patties, some tomatoes and onions and peppers, seasoned with some spices and chili powder and handed it to me. For 10 TL ($3.40) for sandwich and drink, this was about as good as it could possibly get for Istanbul street food! Wow it was so good.12:17 Taksim Square and Turkish Coffee at Mandabatmaz (Istiklal Street) - After that amazing kofte sandwich, we continued walking through Taksim Square, one of the most famous landmarks of Istanbul and then on to the walking Istiklal street.

Although I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to visit an opera performance when I was in Muscat, you can go there and admire it from the outside and take a tour to go inside as well.3:25 Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque - One of the places you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave Muscat without seeing is the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, built of sandstone and marble.

The market is indoor and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just about anything you can imagine for sale from food to household supplies. 3:55 Noor Mohammadi Hotel (Restaurant) - This restaurants was one of the highlights of this day in Mumbai, and we came here specifically to eat a hardcore non-veg dish called nalli nihari. Typically in India the dish is made from buffalo and it includes bone marrow in the stew as well. It was incredibly oily and fatty, but also incredibly delicious. It was like richness on top of richness, and every single bite of the nalli nihari was worth it. The nalli nihari was especially good with the tandoori roti.9:05 Bhendi Bazaar - After enjoying the nalli nihari, we then took a walk through Bhendi Bazaar, another action packed street market in Mumbai. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always something going on at Bhendi Bazaar, and some kind of action taking place.10:30 Mumbai sandwich (Bombay sandwich) - When I spotted a man making sandwiches, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to try it. Known commonly as the Bombay veg or Bombay chutney sandwich, but now also called the Mumbai sandwich, this is a favorite street food snack in Mumbai. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t normally think of sandwiches when you think of Indian food, but there are countless sandwich stalls in Mumbai. In contrast to the non-vegetarian dish I had previously, this Mumbai sandwich was vegetarian, and I got a mix of all the toppings, including tomato, onion, beetroot, cucumber, and cheese, all layered with chutney, and grilled in a fire. The sandwich was quite tasty, especially in a large part because of the different chutneys.14:20 Haji Ali Juice Center / Haji Ali Dargah - Next we took a taxi over to Haji Ali Dargah (mosque), and had a juice at the legendary Haji Ali Juice Center. Unfortunately when we visited Haji Ali Mosque, the ocean tide was too high, so couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk to it.16:46 Mount Mary Church - We then headed to Bandra and first stopped off at Mount Mary Church, one of the most famous basilica\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Mumbai.17:39 Castella de Aguada - Next we went to walk around Castella de Aguada, an old Portuguese fort, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now more like a park and a popular hangout spot.19:00 Elco Restaurant - Since we were in the area, for snack we went to Elco and to have some chaat. We tried sev puri and dahi puri, both of which were very good, and it was nice to get some AC and relaxation indoors for a little while.20:50 Milk dessert - While we were walking around Myron spotted a cart selling a type of milk dessert made from the first milk (colostrum). It was indeed very interesting.22:16 Jai Jawan (Khar branch) - Finally for dinner, out last stop of the day, we walked over to a restaurant called Jai Jawan to eat their prawns fry and tandoori chicken. Dinner was amazing, Jai Jawan is a fantastic restaurant.Music: http://www.audionetwork.com/browse/m/...http://www.audionetwork.com/browse/m/...Star Alliance Round The World: http://www.staralliance.com/en/round-...Disclosure: This trip was made possible by Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets who covered my business class flights.

We then came back to Mumbai, and had amazing Bombay duck at Gomantak restaurant, and then proceeded to have one of the greatest Mumbai street foods, called vada pav.00:22 Elephanta Caves (boat ride 180 INR ($2.69) - One of the worthwhile attractions in Mumbai is the Elephanta Caves, which are a series of historical religious temple caves located on an island off the coast of Mumbai. To get there, you can take a boat from the Gateway of India. We decided to go there first thing in the morning to try to avoid the crowds. I thought it was well worth it. 6:56 Gomantak Boarding House (Dadar West) - One of the top Mumbai foods I wanted to try when I was in Mumbai was Bombay duck, also known and bombil, which is actually not duck at all, but lizardfish. We took a taxi to Dadar West and went to a restaurant called Gomantak that specializes in Malvani cuisine (from the area of Mumbai) and always has Bombay duck on their menu. I ordered the Bombay duck fry, fried pieces of lizardfish that came with the full thali set, including rice and a few curries and chutneys on the side. I also couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist ordering a side dish of pomfret masala. One interesting thing from this amazing Mumbai restaurant was solkadhi - made from coconut milk and kokum fruit, and it was my first time to try it. Total price - 710 INR ($10.60)14:14 Ashok Vada Pav - One of the most important Mumbai street food snacks is vada pav, which is a fried potato cutlet stuffed into a bun and seasoned with some flavorful chutneys and spices. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sometimes known as the Mumbai vegetarian burger. Ashok Vada Pav is known for serving one of the best vada pav in Mumbai, and they also have some serious history to them. When I took my first bite, I knew exactly why it was so popular. It was absolutely sensationally delicious. It was a little on the salty side, but the vada pav was so good, with a balance of salty, spicy, sweet, and crunchy. Vada pav is one of the most popular Mumbai street foods, but at Ashok vada pav you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find one of the best in Mumbai. Vada pav (vada pao) - 20 INR ($0.30).18:36 Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum - 100 INR ($1.49) - After the amazing vada pav, we took a taxi over to the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum, which is another good museum to visit when you are in Mumbai. I especially liked the actual building.19:58 Bagdadi Restaurant - For dinner we headed back to Colaba near to our hotel and ate at another legendary Mumbai restaurant known for serving north Indian Mughlai food. The one dish I had to order was chicken masala fry, and I also got daal and palak paneer. Although all the food was indeed on the buttery and oily side, it was incredibly delicious. Total price - 515 INR ($7.70).Thank you for watching this Mumbai food and travel video. The highlight of the day was the Bombay duck fry and the Mumbai street food vada pav.Music:http://www.audionetwork.com/browse/m/...http://www.audionetwork.com/browse/m/...Star Alliance Round The World: http://www.staralliance.com/en/round-...Disclosure: This trip was made possible by Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets who covered my business class flights.

We woke up early in the morning and got started by visiting some attractions and eating some delicious food. The highlight of the day for me was eating Parsi food for the first time. 2:56 Chai near Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) - One of the greatest joys of visiting India is drinking hot cups of chai on the side of the street. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brewed hot and fresh, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sweet and creamy.4:47 Parsi Food at Britannia and Co. Restaurant - One of the unique types of food to eat in Mumbai is Parsi food, which is a combination of Iranian and Indian food, brought over from Zoroastrians who landed on the east coast of India. Britannia and Co. is a classic restaurant in Mumbai that serves marvelous Parsi food, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a restaurant I was completely looking forward to eating at when I was in Mumbai. The first dish I tried was sali boti, and outstanding dish of cubes of tender mutton in a beautifully flavorful spiced stew. Another Parsi food you have to try at Britannia and Co. is the berry pulav, and I ordered it with chicken. It was a wonderful spiced rice with berries and chicken in the middle. The rice was fluffy and light, and sensational. I also tried the mutton dhansak, another classic Mumbai Parsi food, which was pretty good. Finally, we ended our meal with caramel custard.Read more about Britannia and Co. on my blog: https://migrationology.com/britannia-...14:09 Dhobi Ghat - Driving along to a museum, we stopped at Dhobi Ghat, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest open air laundromat. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too busy, but it was a nice place to see in Mumbai.17:08 Mani Bhavan Gandhi Museum - Next up we visited the Mani Bhavan Gandhi Museum, the house where Gandhi would stay during his visits to Mumbai. The residence is made into a peaceful museum and library.18:27 Pani Puri at Chowpatty Beach (Girgaum Chowpatty) - One of my favorite Indian street food dishes is pani puri, the combination of a puri (hollow chip) filled with spiced potatoes and chickpeas, and filled with flavored water and chutney. After walking around Chowpatty Beach for a while, we walked over to the food stalls on the side, had pani puri from Badshah stall. It was fantastic.25:07 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya - 500 INR ($7.47) - After the Mumbai beach and pani puri, we headed to one of the most famous Mumbai museums and walked around for a while.26:00 Gateway of India - The final stop of the day we headed over to the Gateway of India, one of the most recognizable attractions in Mumbai.26:39 Grilled meat at Bademiya - For the final stop of the night we went to Bademiya Restaurant, one of the famous restaurants in Mumbai for grilled meat like seekh kebabs and chicken bhuna rolls. All the food I ordered was delicious, but I especially enjoyed the chicken bhuna roll. Bademiya restaurant has a pretty big indoor seating section, but they also offer standing space on the road to eat as well.Thank you for watching this day of Mumbai food and attractions in Mumbai, hope you enjoyed it!Music:http://www.audionetwork.com/browse/m/...Star Alliance Round The World: http://www.staralliance.com/en/round-...Disclosure: This trip was made possible by Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets who covered my business class flights.

One of the best parts about this round the world trip is that Star Alliance sponsored us not only for the flights, but for business class flights, and so for this entire trip we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be flying on business class.Air India was quite nice and as soon as we got in the air it was time for dinner. There are both veg and non-veg meal options on Air India, and I chose non-veg, which for dinner happened to be Indian prawns curry, which was served with rice, chapati, daal makhani and a few other side dishes. The prawns curry on Air India was fantastic. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too oily or buttery and it had great flavor with a nice cardamom spice to it.The flight from Bangkok to Mumbai on Air India was about four hours, and both my wife Ying and I fully enjoyed our seats and the relaxation.

From there, we took a prepaid taxi to South Mumbai, to an area of Mumbai called Colaba. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know this at the time, but you can choose to take an AC taxi or a non-AC. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there would be such a big price difference, but the AC taxi to Colaba cost 950 INR ($14.21), while I think the non-AC would have been about half the price.I had pre-booked The Gordon House Hotel in Mumbai.Music:http://www.audionetwork.com/browse/m/...Star Alliance Round The World: http://www.staralliance.com/en/round-...Disclosure: This trip was made possible by Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets who covered my business class flights.

Starting as a small warung, a family local restaurant, the seafood restaurant has grown into one of Jakarta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recognized seafood spots. Even Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President Joko Widodo frequents the restaurant! On this day in Jakarta, I jumped in a taxi to get to Kelapa Gading, and since I had a little extra time, my wife and I first stopped at Pempek Palembang & Otak - Otak 161 to try some very famous pempek Palembang, which is a type of fishcake originally from Palmebang in southern Sumatra. I especially liked the original one with an egg in the middle, but I didn't like the grilled fish ball too much.After Pempek Palembang & Otak - Otak 161, we then walked over to Wiro Sableng Seafood 212 and met up with Leonard and Iyoel to eat seafood. They ordered all the food, and we soon had an incredible Indonesian seafood feast spread on our table. Everything we ate was delicious, but I especially enjoyed the mussels lathered in Padang sauce, and the crab baked in a banana leaf wrapper. And not forgetting the ikan bakar. Ok everything was incredible delicious. Wiro Sableng Seafood 212 is legendary, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for good reason, they serve some incredible food.After finishing the Indonesian seafood feast at Wiro Sableng Seafood 212, we then drove over to Six Ounces Coffee Shop, for an excellent cup of coffee to finish off lunch.Big thank you to Leonard and Iyoel for inviting Ying and I to have lunch!Pempek Palembang & Otak - Otak 161Address: Jalan Boulevard Raya Blok FW I No. 26, Kelapa Gading, JakartaOpen hours: 11 am - 8 pm dailyTotal prices: 60,000 IDR ($4.51)Seafood 212 Wiro SablengAddress: Jalan Boulevard Raya Blok QA III No. 2, Kelapa Gading, Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta, IndonesiaOpen hours: 11 am - 11 pm dailySix Ounces Coffee shopBlok NB 2 No. Kelapa Gading, Jl.

At the end of the day, we also stopped by Fatahillah Square, with is an old Dutch square in colonial Jakarta, where you'll find some interesting buildings and some street food snacks as well.Since we were staying at a hotel (here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s information on the hotel I stayed at:https://migrationology.com/travel-gui...)  not too far from Glodok, we decided to beat the traffic and just walk over there. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take more than 15 minutes to walk, and soon we arrived in Jakarta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinatown. Glodok is a very interesting area to walk around and explore. There are fresh markets and plenty of restaurants and food to choose from.The Indonesian street food I tried on this tour was siomay, an Indonesian Chinese dish. From the back of a motorbike, I chose a few of the siomay dumplings he had steaming, and the cut them up and added some peanut sauce to the plate. The texture was a little mushy, but they were alright. Right opposite the siomay, the owner of an Indonesian vegetarian restaurant greeted me and asked if I might like to eat some of his vegetarian food. His vegetarian rendang was particularly good.One of the most famous places to go in Glodok is Kopi Es Tak Kie, a legendary coffee shop. After wandering around a while we found it. I had a cup of coffee and also a plate of nasi campur from outside the shop.We continued on our Indonesian street food tour throughout Glodok and I tried a sweet snack called kue ape, which is a green colored little pancake. Next, I had a variety of deep fried snacks including fried bananas, and fried breadfruit. They are definitely pretty greasy, but interesting to sample, and they are very popular street food snacks in Indonesia.It probably wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the greatest idea to walk, but we decided to walk over to Fatahillah Square. The traffic was pretty intense, but we made it. And along with checking out the old colonial buildings one of my main goals was to try kerak telor, which is a traditional Indonesian Betawi street food snack. Luckily I found it and it turned out to be a very interesting and amazing snack to watch being made!Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the list of the things we ate and the prices:Siomay - 15,000 IDR ($1.11)Vegetarian food - 20,000 IDR ($1.48)Kopi Es Tak Kie - 10,000 IDR ($0.73) Nasi campur - 35,000 IDR ($2.58)Kue ape - 1,000 IDR ($0.07) eachFried snacks - 12,000 ($0.88)Kerak telor - 20,000 IDR ($1.48) - Possibly overcharged?

And I always knew I needed to come back again to visit Indonesia, this time with my camera. We only had a couple weeks, so rather than try to rush from one place to another (although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love to visit many more islands and cities throughout Indonesia), for this trip, my wife and I just decided to spend our time in Jakarta to really get a feel for the city and its amazing blend of food.We started off at Bangkok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Don Mueang International Airport, the budget airline airport, where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll often fly out of when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking short flights around Southeast Asia. We caught a direct flight from Bangkok to Jakarta and the flight took about 3 \u00c2\u00bd hours from Bangkok to Jakarta.In Jakarta we landed at Soekarno\u00e2\u20ac\u201cHatta International Airport, and after we got our bag, we proceeded to the taxi stand. One of the best taxi brands to take in Indonesia is Blue Bird taxi, and they are very reputable, and have an official stand at the airport. We waited in line just for a few minutes until a Blue Bird taxi came, and we got in. I had pre-booked an Airbnb apartment to stay in, so we took a taxi directly there, located in the heart of Jakarta, in the Mangga Besar area of Jakarta. The taxi ride took probably about 45 minutes and it cost a total of 135,000 IDR ($10.22) - this is a similar price that you would pay for a taxi from the Jakarta international airport to the center of the city.After checking in, we really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what we were doing or where we were, but both Ying and I were hungry. So we took a walk down Mangga Besar road. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the area was famous for Chinese street food, but we found a number of tents selling Indonesian Chinese street food. We were both so hungry that we stopped at a place called Sin Moy Kong Chinese Food. The food was all Chinese, and even though the menu was all in Bahasa Indonesia, I managed to order a few dishes. The food was alright, and our total bill for everything came to 189,000 IDR ($14.31).Many more Indonesian street food videos coming soon!--\u00e2\u2013\u00baJakarta Travel Guide of Food Lovers: http://migrationology.com/travel-guid...MY WEBSITES:Migrationology.com: http://migrationology.com/EatingThaiFood.com: http://eatingthaifood.com/TravelByYing.com: http://travelbyying.com/T-shirts & Food Guides: https://migrationology.com/store/Resources: http://migrationology.com/travel-reso...SOCIAL MEDIA:Snapchat: @migrationologyInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching this Jakarta, Indonesia travel food video!--",

In the early afternoon, we got started for the day, by having some of the most incredible falafel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had in my life, and proceeding to have a few snacks, followed by an amazing Jordanian meal for dinner. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a more details looks at what we did on Day 2 of our Jordan trip.1:02 Falafel Al-Quds - For our first food stop in Amman we went to a famous place called Falafel Al-Quds, known for serving falafel sandwiches on sesame seed buns. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had all that much falafel in my life, but these were definitely some of the best falafel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had in my life. I had the sesame seed falafel sandwich which came filled with falafel, tomatoes, tahini, chili, and some small spices and seasoning. It was simple but incredibly delicious. Sesame seed bun - 0.75 JD ($1.05)4:56 Gerard Ice Cream - Next we walked down Rainbow street in Amman, which by the way has some fantastic little Jordanian restaurants and cafe, and stopped off at Gerard ice cream where I tried ar Arabic ice cream which is flavored by Arabic gum. It tastes sort of like a combination of vanilla and caramel. 1.70 JD ($2.39)6:00 Wild Jordan Cafe - After walking around Amman for a bit and getting some good exercise walking around the hills, we then stopped off at Wild Jordan Cafe to hang out for a bit, drink some coffee and tea, and enjoy the great atmosphere for the cafe and of the Amman Citadel over on the next hill. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a really nice cafe in Amman if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking to hang out.7:26 The Delights Shop - We headed to a certain area of Amman to go to a place called The Delights Shop, known throughout Amman for having incredible dates. While they did have a selection of plain dates, they mostly had a variety of different chocolate covered dates. I had a mint chocolate covered date, which was very sweet and rich and very good. The Delights Shop in Amman is a little high end, but is a good place if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for chocolate covered dates.8:30 Al Osrah Restaurant - Along with eating falafel, our Jordanian food local style dinner at Al Osrah restaurant was definitely the highlight of our first full day of exploring and eating in Amman. This local restaurant served all the typical dishes including hummus, moutabel, falafel again, and a dish that I particularly enjoyed - fattet hummus - which is bread that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soaked until is basically dissolves, and mixed with hummus. While hummus is dense and creamy, the fattet hummus was much lighter and almost had the fluffy consistency of whipped cream. Our meal at Al Osrah was excellent, if you have a chance to eat there when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Amman, the food they serve is wonderful.13:01 Temriyeh Omar - For our final food stop in Amman, we went to a local spot known as Temriyeh Omar to have a Jordanian dessert called temriyeh, which is a then layer of dough, like a roti, filled with a slice of semolina cake, wrapped up into a little packet, and deep fried to a crisp. Once it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken out of the hot oil, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s then dusted in powdered sugar. It was sweet, but very good.--Check out my travel tips and visiting recommendations for Amman, Jordan: http://migrationology.com/travel-guid...

I want to say a big thank you to the Jordan Tourism Board for making this trip happen!I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m based in Bangkok, Thailand, and so on Day 1 of our trip, my wife and I caught a direct flight from Bangkok to Amman, Jordan with Royal Jordanian airlines. The flight was alright, and it took about 10 hours on our direct flight. We arrived to Queen Alia International Airport, early in the morning at about 5 am, where we were greeted by a representative from Visit Jordan, and proceed to go through customs and immigration and grabbed out bag. We then met with our driver and guide, who brought us directly to La Locanda Boutique Hotel, where we would be staying for the next few days.As soon as I arrived to Amman, I was hungry - after all, it was already noon lunchtime in Bangkok. Luckily it was about 7 am when we checked into our hotel, and so we dropped off our bags and immediately went to have breakfast as the hotel. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a huge fan of Jordanian breakfast, and I had a bunch of raw vegetables, some bread, and lots of hummus and finally some ful medames for breakfast. It was a fantastic change from what I normally eat for breakfast.After finishing breakfast, we headed back to our room to sleep for a couple hours, before heading out to do some eating and exploring in Amman.

You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find a tempting variety of different Indian food stalls to choose from, many of them serving south Indian dishes. You can get paratha, banana leaf rice and curry, and what I chose to eat was chicken biryani from a famous stall called Allauddin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. But before beginning with my chicken biryani, I first had an onion paratha, a greasy and crispy pieces of fried bread filled with onions and served with a side of curry sauce. It was pretty good. But nothing compared to my plate of chicken biryani. The rice was fluffy and fragrant, and not too dry, but had some nice moisture to it. The chicken was incredible - it was soft, yet not mushy at all, but remained a fantastic silky texture. Finally, the curry sauce that my plate of biryani was served with is what really elevated the plate to the next level.For a wonderful plate of chicken biryani in Singapore, head over to Allauddin's Chicken Biryani at Tekka Centre.--MY WEBSITES:Singapore Travel Guide: http://migrationology.com/travel-guid...Singapore Food Guide: http://migrationology.com/2016/01/sin...T-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Resources I use: http://migrationology.com/travel-reso...Migrationology.com: http://migrationology.com/EatingThaiFood.com: http://eatingthaifood.com/TravelByYing.com: http://travelbyying.com/SOCIAL MEDIA:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologySnapchat: @migrationologyThank you very much for watching this video!--",

Things didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go quite as planned, as our first flight was canceled, but we did end up making it to Boracay at the end of the day, and then got checked into Discovery Shores Hotel.Anton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/antondiaz00:30 Going to the Airport - We took a taxi in the morning to the airport, and arrived and checked in. The line and security was pretty tight, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take too long.2:08 Flight Canceled and Rebooked - Cebu Pacific is notorious in the Philippines for delayed and canceled flights, and today was no different. We were supposed to fly from Manila to Caticlan, but our flight was canceled, and we had to re-route on another flight to Kalibo airport, about 2 hours from Boracay.2:36 Lunch at Airport - Lunch at the airport wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything too impressive, nor was the food supplied by Cebu Pacific.4:55 Flight to Kalibo, Boracay - Finally, even our re-routed flight was late by 1.5 hours, but we finally took off the Kalibo Airport, towards Boracay island.6:19 Where is Boracay? - Boracay is a small island off the coast of Aklan. The closest airport is Caticlan, and about 2 hours away is another airport called Kalibo. 7:19 Boat ride to Boracay - After taking a van for about 2 hours to get to the pier, we then took a quick boat ride to Boracay island and we headed to Discovery Shores Hotel where we stayed for 2 nights.10:00 Dinner at Discovery Shores Boracay - Dinner was served on the beach, along with Anton and his family, and everything was pretty good.Disclosure: We were invited to stay at Discovery Shores Boracay, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay for our stay.

Enjoy this Taiwanese street food day trip tour!\u00e2\u2013\u00baGet more Taiwanese street food in my Taipei guide: https://goo.gl/PbAuzQ\u00e2\u2013\u00baSubscribe to my videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribeOn Day 10 in Taipei, Taiwan, Ying and I decided to take a day trip to Jiufen (of Jiu Fen) and on to Keelung City and have a day of eating Taiwanese street food. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m extremely happy we had a chance to briefly visit both Jiufen and Keelung City. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just quickly go over where and how we went from Taipei to Jiufen and then on to Keelung City using timecodes so you can come back to a location in the video easily if you want to.0:38 How to Get from Taipei to Jiufen by BusUsing the directly I read off Wikipedia travel guide, we took the Taipei Metro to Zhongxiao Fuxing Station, then took exit 1 (Andong Street) and made an immediate u-turn, walked to the intersection and made a left, and then the bus stop was right there on the right hand side. We somehow arrived to the bus stop right as 1062 arrived and if Taiwan couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make things any more easy and efficient we boarded the bus using our easy cards. The bus ride from Taipei central there to the small town of Jiufen took just over 1 hour, and we soon arrived in the touristy, but very beautiful and pleasant town of Jiufen - which is one of the biggest little tourist towns in Taiwan. You can choose to take a day trip to Jiufen from Taipei like we did, or you can even spend the night or a few nights there.2:45 Taiwanese street food at JiufenJiufen is a small little mountain town in Taiwan about 1 hour from Taipei with a great view of the ocean\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turned into a major tourism destination. Although you can go there to do some shopping and buy some souvenirs, by far the main reason to go to Jiufen on a day trip is to eat as much Taiwanese street food and snacks as you can - and also there are plenty of sit-down restaurant you can eat at as well. Ying and I started our day of eating Taiwan street food by eating a plate of snails and a plate of grilled squid, both of which had quite a similar texture, and the flavor was delicious. After the snails and squid, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist having a Taiwanese tea egg, one of the most popular snacks. After walking around and taking loads of photos of the picturesque scenes around Jiufen, Ying and I stopped at a real restaurant to take a little break, cool down from the hot sun, and eat some more food - this time at a real restaurant. I tried a dish called three cup chicken, which was deliciously comforting. Another very famous food to eat in Jiufen is the sweet taro balls, which was pretty good. 12:24 How to get from Jiufen to Keelung City on Bus #788After spending a few hours wandering around Jiufen, we took the bus from just up the road directly to Keelung City, one of the harbour towns in Taiwan, and about a 45 minute drive from Jiufen. The reason we wanted to go to Keelung City was to go to Keelung Miaokou Night Market, one of the most famous Taiwanese street food markets in Taiwan.13:35 Street food at Keelung Miaokou Night MarketOne of the most well known night markets in Taiwan is Keelung Miaokou Night Market, located right in Keelung City, and home to an abundance of delicious things to eat. I was actually still quite full from all the food we had already eaten in Jiufen, but I did manage to try a few things at the night market, and also I just really enjoyed the ambiance and atmosphere of the market. Ying and I luckily got a table and chairs at a small street food stall serving long finger sized dumplings, which were similar to gyoza. They were filled with minced pork and lots of green onions. Along with a plate of pickled cucumbers, and a plate of tofu, they were some of the best potsticker style dumplings I had on my entire trip to Taiwan. I also tried crab soup, and a famous street food called a Nutritious Sandwich.Day 10 in Taiwan, and eating all sorts of Taiwanese street food snacks in both Jiufen and Keelung City was an excellent day trip.Music in this video is from Audio NetworkTimothy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/timothyk...This video was produced by Mark Wiens and Ying Wiens, for more information about us, check out our blogs: http://migrationology.com/blog & http://www.eatingthaifood.com/ & http://www.travelbyying.com/Twitter: https://twitter.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologySNAPCHAT: migrationologyMake a donation: http://migrationology.com/donate/Resources I use: http://migrationology.com/travel-reso...Premium Travel Guides: http://migrationology.com/travel-guides/Ready my Taipei Travel Guide for more tips about visiting Taipei: https://migrationology.com/travel-gui...",

            "description": "\u00e2\u2013\u00baRead more about Naty's Filipino Food Kitchen here:  http://migrationology.com/2015/06/fil...Back in 2010, I spent about 2 month in the Philippines, exploring, doing all sorts of things, and eating all sorts of food. The amazing people I met, and the delicious food I ate, contributed to it being a very memorable trip. This time, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it back to the Philippines yet (however, I hope to visit soon in the future), but when I was in Honolulu, Hawaii, I came pretty close to the real thing at a restaurant called Naty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kitchen at the Maunakea Marketplace in Honolulu.The Maunakea Marketplace is located right in the heart of Chinatown in Honolulu, and if you walk inside the marketplace, and go to the food court section, it honestly feels like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve left Hawaii altogether, and have transported yourself into a market in Manila or somewhere in southeast Asia - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my kind of spot. There are a few different types of food to eat at Maunakea Marketplace, including a couple Thai stalls, but by far the dominating cuisine in Filipino food, and there are about 5 different Filipino food stalls to choose from. One of the most well known, and also they offer the most selection of dishes is Naty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kitchen. Naty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kitchen dishes out all the prepared food and has them all on display in the from cabinet, and you just pick and choose the different dishes that you want, which will then all be piled into a styrofoam container. Typically most customers might get a box with 2 dishes and rice, but I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist ordering 3 dishes and then a bowl of sinigang soup on the side.After getting my rice, I ordered the pork dinuguan, one of the more noticeable Filipino foods of pork and blood made into a stew. Although it might not look the most appealing, and some people even call it chocolate pork, it actually tastes quite amazing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost like blood sausage without the casing, except it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much more moist and has a gravy. The taste was very nice, almost with a slight hint of a livery flavor and just a slightly sour flavor as well. At first I was also going to order the pork adobo, which is one of the most well known Filipino foods, but it was made with pork belly and after seeing how oily it was, I asked the Aunty if she had any other recommendations. She pointed to the pork igado, which she said had a similar flavor to adobo, but it was made with a less fatty cut of pork. The igado was excellent, including tender chunks of pork, in a pepper and vinegar sour sauce. Along with my rice, it was very good. The last dish I got on my plate has always been one of my favorite Filipino foods, a dish called pinakbet, which is a mixture of different vegetables fried up with shrimp paste. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly shrimpy or overly salty, just had an excellent fragrance, and a good mixture of vegetables that went well with all the pork dishes. Also, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist getting an order of pork sinigang. When I was in the Philippines I really enjoyed eating fish sinigang, a sour tamarind soup, but here at Naty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kitchen in Honolulu this day, they only had the pork version. The flavor of the soup was very good, but the pork made it a little on the oily side - it was good but I would have preferred the fish version.Naty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kitchen is an excellent and quite authentic restaurant in Hawaii that serves delicious Filipino food. Naty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kitchen - Maunakea Market Place, ChinatownOpen hours: I went there at about 11 am on a weekday and they were open and thriving, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure of their exact business hoursPrices: All the food I ate and ordered above cost $11 How to get there: Naty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kitchen is located in Chinatown at Maunakea Market Place right in Honolulu, Hawaii. If you can find street parking that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great, otherwise there is a municipal parking garage nearby.

My wife and I are based in Bangkok, so we woke up early to catch our flight from Bangkok to Langkawi, and we arrived just in time for lunch.After grabbing our bag from Langkawi airport we jumped in the car and took a drive to Seashells Restaurant, located in laman padi, a rice field. The setting of the restaurant was really nice, with wooden cabanas built over the top of a rice field. We ordered a few different nasi campur dishes, including daging kurma, a beef and coconut milk curry and ayam masak merah, a red chicken curry as well, and we also got some other chicken curry, omelet, and finally both fried fish and Malaysian grilled fish known as ikan bakar. I thought the food was over quite good, and the setting inside the rice field was also very nice.Lunch accomplished we headed to The Andaman hotel, located on the very northwestern side of Langkawi island. But on the way driving there, we stopped at a local food stall where we enjoyed a few local deep fried snacks and fritters and a donut. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll admit, even though I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a big sweets fan, that everything was quite tasty - I especially liked the little deep fried banana bread balls.The Andaman is a very nice hotel, with a private stretch of beach, and so the first thing, after walking around the hotel was to take a swim. After the swim, we ate dinner at Jala Restaurant, a restaurant that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located at The Andaman hotel.It was a great day traveling from Bangkok to Langkawi, and thank you to Naturally Langkawi for organizing this trip.Thank you for watching this video!****************************************************Music in this video is from Audio NetworkBy Mark Wiens and Ying Wiens: http://migrationology.com/blog & http://www.eatingthaifood.com/ & http://www.travelbyying.com/I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love to be in touch with you:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyTwitter: https://twitter.com/migrationologySNAPCHAT: migrationology\u00e2\u2013\u00baSupport our videos: https://www.patreon.com/markwiens",

            "description": "Broadway Market is a Saturday market in London where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find a variety of delicious food. Check out my blog here: http://migrationology.com/When you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in London on the weekends, one of the best things to do is go to one of the weekend markets. Broadway Market has been around since the late 1800\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, when it was a small neighborhood street. According to their website (http://www.broadwaymarket.co.uk/), the market began in the 1890\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and it was originally a place where people started selling their local produce. The market thrived, but during the years, as the economy went up and down, the market eventually passed and pretty much came to an end for a number of years.In the recent years, Broadway Market in London has experienced a bit of a renaissance and made a comeback in a big way. Every Saturday, starting around 8 or 9 am, food and produce vendors set up along Broadway road on the East side of London, in Hackney. Many people show up, hungry, ready to eat, and ready to shop for good quality produce and food products. What I really loved about the market is the friendly neighborhood feel to it. Lots of people gathered with friend to hang out, have a beer or a cup of tea, eat some delicious food, and just enjoy the great social atmosphere of the market.When I visited London, Ying and I were on a short trip with Chowzter.com, and one of the things we did while in town, was visit the market. It was my first day in London, so I was pretty excited to get out and explore the market and start to eat as much as I could. I was quite happy with the selection of international foods available at the market, ranging from Ghanaian food to Vietnamese and even Thai food. But, since I had just come from Thailand, I was actually trying to stick with more English / UK or at least more European food for the trip. The first thing I tried was some kind of a chocolate brownie cookie filled with cream. Overall, it was quite good, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just not a huge fan of sweets.I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a huge fan of smoked salmon, so when I noticed the stall selling smoked Atlantic salmon, that was immediately on my food radar. They were just serving a slab of smoked salmon on a piece of bread along with a garnish of cream cheese and piece of dill. The combo was incredibly good, the smoked salmon was marvelous. It had been a long time since I had eaten smoked salmon, so I was pretty happy, and it was very tasty. A Scotch egg is something I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve wanted to eat for a long time, but I had never had the chance. So walking around Broadway Market, I noticed the Scotch eggs, and could not resist. She had a number of different version, but the one that caught my eye the most was the haggis Scotch egg, which was basically a hard boiled egg, covered in haggis sausage, lightly breaded, then deep fried. When I ordered it, she sliced it in half, gave it a pinch of salt, and handed it to me. It was an awesome protein ball, egg, covered in haggis meat, and I loved every bite of it. To get some more meat, I decided to get a roast piri piri chicken at the end. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best chicken I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had, perhaps it was a little bland, but it did taste good, and it was pretty cheap for a big amount of chicken. Finally to round out my eating food trip to Broadway Market, I got a couple aubergine rolls, which were eggplant stuffed with feta cheese and a few herbs and spices. They were very tasty, and a great way to end the day at the market in London.Music in this video courtesy of Audio Network: http://www.audionetwork.com/productio...Mark is the eater at: http://migrationology.com/blog & http://www.eatingthaifood.com/blog/Thai food guide: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/eating-...Resources: http://migrationology.com/travel-reso...Get my newsletter: http://migrationology.com/food-newsInstagram: http://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts: http://migrationology.spreadshirt.com/Finally, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to subscribe for more food videos every Sunday and Wednesday: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...Thank you for watching, see you on the next video! - Mark Wiens",

            "description": "Borough Market is one of the most famous and renowned fresh markets in London. Get all information here: http://migrationology.com/2014/05/bor...There are many famous things to do in London, but if you're a food lover like I am, one of the best choices you can make it to take a trip to the historical Borough Market. The market is one of the most well-known in all of London. The history goes way back, and it was formerly a place where people came and gathered to trade and sell their fresh produce. For many years it was very informal and without structure. But the official Borough Market was established in 1885, the place that we can visit today.We were only in London for a couple of days, attending the Chowzter.com food awards (http://chowzter.com/), and one thing I knew we needed to do, was visit Borough Market with an empty stomach. It was Friday morning at about 10 AM when we decided to go - and I think it was just about a perfect time - because many of the vendors were just opening up, and the market wasn't as packed as it could be. The best things to do as soon as you arrive to Borough Market is to take a leisurely stroll around and see what is available for you to eat - there are too many things to eat in one visit, so it's important that you choose wisely, and decide what you want to eat.Some of the most famous things include the salt beef sandwich, the grilled cheese sandwich, the duck confit sandwich, chorizo, and many other delicious things. But along with cooked food, there's also a range of cured meats, and wonderful cheeses. I also really enjoyed the fresh produce, which included a nice variety of mushrooms and beautiful heirloom tomatoes.But anyway let's get back to the food, and I'm talking about the food ready to be eaten. As soon as I arrived I saw a stack of cheese and olive bread-sticks which were piled high like a pyramid. That was my first treat. The long bread-stick was crusty and embedded with salty cheese and delicious olives. While walking around, in the back part Borough Market, we decided to try a Portuguese egg tart. It was good but I thought it could've been better if it was a little warmer. Next up we tried a sausage on a stick from a place called Boston Sausage. I added a bunch of English mustard to it, and I think that's what made it so good.If you want to drink coffee, when you visit London's Borough Market you cannot miss the famous Monmouth coffee shop. It can be quite busy and hard to find a seat, so we decided just to get takeaway coffee, as I really needed something to wake me up and keep me energized to eat more. My little shot of macchiato was fantastic.Back to the food, we went to a place called Brindisa and ordered up one of their famous chorizo sandwiches. The chorizo was very tasty, and had a nice spicy flavor to it, but I thought the bread was way too big for the amount of meat. If I ordered it again, I would for sure get the double chorizo. Finally for my last sandwich at Borough Market, I went with the famous duck confit sandwich. You'll see the incredible pan of duck confit when you visit the market, and if you're like me, it should entice you to eat it immediately. When you order, the vendor fills up a bunch of duck into a ciabatta roll. The duck was incredibly tender, juicy, and oily, and it was amazingly tasty. That just about wrapped up everything I ate at Borough Market in London. There were still many more things I wanted to try, but like I said, it would be a near impossible feat to eat everything in one visit to the market. If you want to eat and you're in London, this is one of the best places to visit.Visit Borough Market information:Open for lunch on Monday -- Tuesday from 11 am -- 5 pmFull market is open on Wednesday -- Thursday from 11 am -- 5 pm, Friday from 10 am -- 6 pm, and Saturday from 8 am -- 5 pm (closed on Sunday)Prices: It would not be hard to spend 20 GBP per person eating hereWebsite: http://boroughmarket.org.uk/How to get to there: I think the easiest way is to take the London underground tube to London Bridge Station and then just follow the exit signs that will lead directly to Borough Market.Music in this video courtesy of Audio NetworkMark WiensEater at: http://migrationology.com/blog & http://www.eatingthaifood.com/blog/Resources and guides: http://migrationology.com/travel-reso...T-shirts: http://migrationology.spreadshirt.com/Thank you for watching, and don't forget to subscribe: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...",

            "description": "Kategna restaurant was one of the best restaurants I ate at while I was in Addis Ababa. The menu is extremely extensive, and the food is amazing! More info: http://migrationology.com/2014/01/kat...One of the highlights of visiting Ethiopia, is eating Ethiopian food, and when you're in Addis Ababa there are many amazing restaurants to choose from. Kategna Restaurant is a well known favorite for locals that live in Addis Ababa, straight up because it's a nice environment, and most importantly, the food is outstanding. During the course of my stay in Addis Ababa, I went to Kategna restaurant a number of times, unable to resist the delicious flavors and nice atmosphere of the restaurant.I began with a giant platter of Yetsom Beyaynetu, a mix of vegetarianan fasting dishes. The mix came out, beautifully arranged on a giant platter, filled with the wonderful assortment of different curries and stews. There was misir wat, a red lentil stew, some different kinds of salads, and gomen, which is collard greens. Though it might not be a traditional method of ordering, I decided to go for another dish known as doro wat, a famous Ethiopian food that's a chicken stew made from onions, berbere spices, and lots of butter. Also, the egg in the doro wat is one of the highlights. The doro wat was scooped directly onto the pile of injera, mingling with the other wonderful ingredients.As you can already imagine, I was so incredibly excited to begin my feast at Kategna restaurant, my mouth juices were flowing. There were two different colors of injera that I got served, something I didn't really notice from other restaurants I ate at while I was in Addis Ababa. But after tasting both, they really almost tasted identical. I quickly grabbed pieces of injera, ripping it off the roll and digging it into the juicy curries. The flavor combination were out of control delicious. The vegetarian mix of yetsom beaynetu was excellent. Then it was time to devour the doro wat. The piece of chicken was oddly small, just a time bone with a little bit of meat, but the sauce and egg together were so delicious, that I honestly almost forgot about the chicken itself. The sauce was dripping with flavor!Despite Kategna restaurant being on the nicer side of the restaurant spectrum, the prices are incredibly reasonable. For me entire feast in the video, including the coffee at the end, our total bill came to 230 ETB ($11.85), and believe it or not, I was actually stuffed full for almost the entire day afterwards, I hardly have to eat any dinner! There are two main locations of the restaurant in Addis Ababa, one just off Gabon street (the one featured in this video) and the other is just off Bole road very near to the airport. I went to both locations during my time in Addis, and they were both of equal greatness, and even the atmosphere was just about the same. When you visit Addis Ababa, one of the best restaurants is Kategna restaurant, and you should not miss out on the opportunity to eat there!Get my FREE street food guide: http://wp.me/Psd9b-4plFollow my adventures on http://migrationology.com/blog & http://www.eatingthaifood.com/blog/Bangkok 101 Guide: http://migrationology.com/ebook-101-t...Thai Food Guide: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/eating-...Thank you so much for watching this food and travel video by Mark Wiens.

            "description": "For incredible home cooked Tanzanian food in Dar Es Salaam, you should go to Grace Shop. Details here http://migrationology.com/2013/12/gra...While I was in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, I was able to eat at quite a few local restaurants, some of them good, while others weren't the best. On one of my last days in the city, I got tipped by a friend to eat at a small local restaurants known simply as Grace Shop. It wasn't even much of a restaurant, but more of a small kiosk located in the spread out neighborhood of Oysterbay, just barely onto the Peninsula. I normally would never come to this area looking for good Tanzanian food as it's sort of an expat area, but I sure was surprised this time.So Grace Shop is a located in a Pepsi painted little kiosk, and at first when I walked up, I didn't even known if I had come to the right place - one reason was because I saw a bunch of wedding gowns in the store window. But I peeked my head inside, and sure enough, there were tables set up and the food was about to be ready to be served. Who would have known that a wedding gown rental store could serve such good Tanzanian food? The restaurant is pretty small, housing only a few tables on the inside and a couple of tables outside. For the lighting, I chose to sit outside and enjoy the cool outdoor breeze, with what would soon by one of the best Tanzanian food meals I've ever enjoyed in my life.When we arrived, the food wasn't quite ready for lunch, I my anticipation grew as we waited. It didn't take more than a few minutes before I noticed a wheelbarrow pulling up to the back of the restaurant. This was something new for me... being served out of a wheelbarrow - and Tanzanian street food! The food is actually cooked in the house behind Grace Shop, and then it's transported to the little restaurants front to be sold. When the food was ready, it was all unloaded into the back little kitchen room and ready to be served. Everyday for lunch, there are numerous Tanzanian food dishes all laid out and you can pick and choose whatever looks the best. I wanted to eat everything, but of course I had to make up my mind and pick a few things.I began this Tanzanian food meal with a big scoop of beef pilau, which was rice cooked with huge chunks of beef and oil. Then I chose a deep fried salted fish. From there, the servers piled on all the side dishes like vegetables and beans and sauces, and all sorts of other delicious items. My plate of Tanzanian food was colorful and smelled so amazing I could hardly wait. It was definitely one of the best, if not the best Tanzanian food, home-cooked, meal I've ever had in my life. Everything was spiced and salted to perfection. The rice was oily and had a hint of cinnamon, the fish was salty and crispy, the beans were hearty, and the fresh veggies were fresh and full of flavor. Even the chili was banging hot! Sometimes Tanzanian food can be good, and other times not so good, but this was one of the best Tanzanian food lunches I've ever eaten!How to get to Grace Shop, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania:Grace Shop is located in the Oyster Bay part of Dar Es Salaam, just behind the Kenya High Commission. From Ali Hassan Mwinyi, turn onto Kaunda Drive, make your first left (it's Bongoyo Road), and Grace Shop is about 200 meters up the road on your right hand side.Open hours -- Eat there for lunch, food should be ready around noonPrice -- 5,000 TZS ($3) for my monster plate of food that included both beef and fish, other plates can cost just 3,000 TZS ($1.82)Follow my food adventures at http://migrationology.com/ & http://www.eatingthaifood.com/ & http://travelbyying.com/Bangkok 101 Guide: http://migrationology.com/ebook-101-t...Thai Food Guide: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/eating-...Thank you so much for watching this food and travel video by Mark Wiens.

For more information check out my website: http://migrationology.com/No matter what area of Nepal you are in, when you're looking for delicious home cooked Nepali food, you'll find dal bhat. The great thing about dal bhat is that it's a delicious meal. Dal means soup, which is usually a lentil soup similar to the Indian version of dal, but a little soupier. Bhat on the other hand is a main staple starch, which normally indicated rice, but if rice is not available, it can mean another form of starch to go with the sides.A meal of Nepali dal bhat (\u00e0\u00a4\u00a6\u00e0\u00a4\u00be\u00e0\u00a4\u00b2\u00e0\u00a4\u00ad\u00e0\u00a4\u00be\u00e0\u00a4\u00a4) all begins on a big metal plate which is piled high with rice. The dal soup is normally place in a small metal bowl and served on the side. While this is the barebones Nepali food combination, usually more sides are added to make the meal more complete. Dal bhat tarkari (\u00e0\u00a4\u00a6\u00e0\u00a4\u00be\u00e0\u00a4\u00b2 \u00e0\u00a4\u00ad\u00e0\u00a4\u00be\u00e0\u00a4\u00a4 \u00e0\u00a4\u00a4\u00e0\u00a4\u00b0\u00e0\u00a4\u2022\u00e0\u00a4\u00be\u00e0\u00a4\u00b0\u00e0\u00a5\u20ac) for instance, is the rice and dal combination along with a side of seasonal vegetables - often some kind of green vegetable fried up or curried cauliflower. Also, if you like to eat meat, there's often the option of ordering chicken, buffalo, or beef curry to accompany your meal. I personally loved chicken and buffalo curry and also a dish they call chicken chilly. For this particular Nepali food meal I was just wandering around Kathmandu, actually getting my Thai visa, when I became extremely hungry. Nepali local restaurants are often hidden from the road by curtains which you have to pull back in order to see what's going on. This was why it was sometimes hard to find food in Nepal, because restaurants are often hidden by drapes. But nevertheless, peek your head into a curtain and there's usually something delicious. This small neighborhood restaurant was owned by a motherly lady who had a selection of delicious dishes all prepared when I arrived. I just ordered the dal bhat (\u00e0\u00a4\u00a6\u00e0\u00a4\u00be\u00e0\u00a4\u00b2\u00e0\u00a4\u00ad\u00e0\u00a4\u00be\u00e0\u00a4\u00a4) and when she asked me if I wanted chicken, I couldn't resist. A plate of rice, peas and potatoes curry, chicken curry, and dal was what came with my meal. After downing my first helping, she then brought more more and more food, a bowl of chickpeas that were slightly cold and still quite firm, and a soft boiled egg, which I was extremely excited about.The egg was soft boiled so the yolk and even some of the white were still soft and perfect to go over my plate of rice. Along with some of the achar chili sauce, a sort of Nepali food salsa, the egg was incredible! Dal bhat makes a wonderful and fulfilling meal when you're in Nepal. It's served fresh, it's for the most part nutritious, and it really satisfies when you're hungry!Follow our food adventures at http://migrationology.com/ & http://www.eatingthaifood.com/ & http://travelbyying.com/Bangkok 101 Guide: http://migrationology.com/ebook-101-t...Thai Food Guide: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/eating-...Finally, subscribe so you don't miss the next tasty adventure http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...",

            "description": "Get more things to do in Kuala Lumpur, and travel tips: http://migrationology.com/2014/02/kua...I'm Mark Wiens and thank you very much for watching this video about a few of the top things to do in Kuala Lumpur, a city that just happens to be one of my favorite cities to visit in Southeast Asia. It's the largest and probably the most important and influential city in Malaysia and truly has some amazing sites to offer. Along with modern skyrise towers like the Petronas Towers, there are still lots of traditional historic buildings as well. The awesome mixture of cultures, the mix of traditional and modern, and very importantly, the outstanding cuisine is what makes Kuala Lumpur such a great city to explore!1. On this list of top things to do in Kuala Lumpur I first stop by the most famous landmark of the the city: the Petronas Towers. These twin giant sky scrapers are huge, and they literally reach towards the heavens and touch the clouds. On the bottom of the Petronas Towers is a pretty fancy shopping mall while the tops of the towers are filled with offices. On the 41st and 42nd floor, there is a sky bridge which connects the two towers together and which is open for visitors. Years ago, it used to be free entrance but unfortunately now they have started to charge a rather steep 80 Malaysian Ringgits per person. 2. After the visiting the Petronas towers, number two on the list is the historical district of old Kuala Lumpur. Visiting and walking around the area is one of the top things to do in Kuala Lumpur and you shouldn't miss the opportunity. From Merdeka Square to the old railroad station, you'll see some amazing architecture and buildings. Another must visit is the National Mosque, which is known as Masjid Negara. With a capacity of 15,000, this is the central and most visited mosque in the city.3. The Menara KL Tower, along with the Petronas Towers, is one of the dominating features of Kuala Lumpur's skyline. At 421 meters in height, it's one of the world's tallest communications towers. I was lucky enough to be invited to the annual BASE jumping event which was held at the KL Tower so I had a pass to go to the top for the incredible view and to see the event (http://migrationology.com/2012/10/jor...). The KL Tower also offer look out viewpoints and a number of restaurants where you can dine with an incredible view.4. Number 4 is Little India which is better known as Brickfields. Kuala Lumpur is home to many Indian's many from the south of the country. Brickfields is a popular place to browse, shop for all sorts of Indian products and most importantly to eat at some seriously delicious Indian restaurants. If you're looking for good Indian food in Kuala Lumpur, check out this restaurant: http://migrationology.com/2012/11/sou...5. Chinatown, located on Petaling Street, is one of the biggest Kuala Lumpur attractions. It's mostly known for it street shopping and restaurants. You can find all sorts of fake brand names and nearly everything imaginable.6. Thean Hou Temple is one of the most impressive Daoist temples in Kuala Lumpur. It's free to visit and offers insights into the Hainanese community in the city and there are also great views of the city.7. Central Market, is a top tourist shopping attraction in Kuala Lumpur. Though many of the products are rather touristy, there are some good things waiting to be found.8. Within central Kuala Lumpur are the KL Lake Gardens and Bird Park. It makes a great tropical escape to the bustling city life.9. The Batu Caves, located just outside the central part of the city is one of the best things to do in Kuala Lumpur. The caves and shrines are one of the most sacred Hindu sites outside of India.10. Chow Kit Market is the central fresh wet market in the city. Everyday thousands of shoppers get their Malaysian food ingredients at this interesting market.11. Malaysian food is the ultimate attraction to visiting Kuala Lumpur. With a great mixture of local Malay, Chinese, and Indian, there's no shortage of incredible dining that will leave you satisfied and hungry for more! For myself, eating is one of the best things to do in Kuala Lumpur!Hope you enjoyed this list and hope you have a wonderful visit!Music in this video is Feel Free by Joe Sacco.Direct Link: http://www.premiumbeat.com/royalty_fr...License: https://www.premiumbeat.com/member/li...I purchased the song used in this video royalty free from Premium Beats, and I have full rights to use it in within my video.All of the information and footage in this video was taken in October 2012 and is all copyright of Mark Wiens who is the author of http://migrationology.com/ and http://www.eatingthaifood.com/.

Today's recipe is not only delicious and easy, but it makes a big batch, so it's perfect for sharing with all of your friends and family during the holidays. It's a \"jamaretti\" cookie (a.k.a. an amaretti cookie with a jam center) with a sugar glaze. These little treats are every bit as delightful as jam-filled thumbprints but take about half the time to make since they're sliced after baking (meaning you don't need a single cookie cutter to make this recipe). And since this dough can be prepped and frozen up to a week in advance, you can plan ahead for your next cookie swap!

The mussels are cooked in an intensely fragrant broth of garlic, scallions, tomatoes, fennel fronds, and a touch of vermouth (John says it helps to bring out the sweetness of the mussels). These mussels were so tasty, I couldn't help but eat them right out of the pot. Make this heartfelt meal for your family and learn more about John's books and projects at ChefJohnBesh.com.Sarah's Tip of the Day: Using your fingers or a paring knife, pull down firmly on the wispy strings attached to the mussels and discard before cooking (while edible, the mussels' \"beard\" have an unpleasant texture).Subscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt---------------------------------------------------------------PREP: 10 MINS TOTAL TIME: 20 MINSSERVINGS:6INGREDIENTS4 pounds mussels1/4 cup olive oil1 bunch scallions, thinly slicedPinch fennel fronds, chopped4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced2 medium tomatoes, choppedPinch crushed red pepper1 cup dry vermouth2 sprigs thyme2 sprigs fresh parsley, choppedCoarse salt and freshly ground black pepperLeaves from 4 sprigs fresh basil, slicedCrusty bread, for servingDIRECTIONSSTEP 1Rinse and scrub the mussels under cold running water.

Today's recipe fits that description perfectly; it's a lightened-up version of classic chicken enchiladas. Spiced up with chipotles in adobo and fragrant cumin, this cheesy recipe is one of my absolute favorites. And it's freezer friendly! Double this recipe so you can enjoy it tonight and all season long!Sarah's Tip of the Day: Chipotles in adobo (i.e., smoked, dried jalapenos in sauce) pack some serious heat. To temper the spice, remove their seeds before cooking.Subscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt---------------------------------------------------------------PREP: 20 MINS TOTAL TIME: 45 MINSSERVINGS:4INGREDIENTSCoarse salt and ground pepper3 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (6 to 8 ounces each)2 tablespoons vegetable oil, such as safflower2 garlic cloves, minced1/4 cup all-purpose flour1 teaspoon ground cumin1 to 2 tablespoons minced canned chipotles in adobo1 can (14 1/2 ounces) reduced-sodium chicken broth8 corn tortillas (6-inch)1/2 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese (2 ounces)COOK'S NOTEChipotles in adobo (smoked, dried jalapenos in sauce) are spicy -- for less heat, scrape out ribs and seeds. You'll find them in the international aisle.DIRECTIONSSTEP 1In a large skillet with a tight-fitting lid, bring 1 inch salted water to a boil. Add chicken. Cover; reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer 5 minutes; remove skillet from heat. Let chicken steam, covered, until opaque throughout, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer chicken to a medium bowl; shred with two forks. Set aside.STEP 2While chicken is cooking, make sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add flour, cumin, and chipotles in adobo; cook, whisking, 1 minute. Whisk in broth and 1/2 cup water; bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, and cook, whisking occasionally, until sauce has thickened slightly, 5 to 8 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Transfer 1 cup sauce to bowl with chicken; toss to combine.STEP 3Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Pour 1/4 cup sauce into bottom of an 8-inch square baking dish; set aside. Stack tortillas, and wrap in a double layer of damp paper towels; microwave until hot, about 1 minute. Fill each tortilla with chicken mixture; roll up tightly, and arrange, seam side down, in baking dish. Cover with remaining sauce, and top with cheese. Bake until hot and bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes.

Today's recipe for chili-glazed meatloaf is equally delicious whether it's just out of the oven or the freezer. All you need to do to create two night's worth of meals is to separate this recipe into two loaf pans. What could be easier? And while the spicy sauce infuses the meat with some serious flavor, it's not intensely hot (meaning your whole family can enjoy the same dish). Bon appetit -- tonight or any night!Sarah's Tip of the Day: Form your loaf into a log and then gently drop it into your loaf pan. Avoid pressing it down, which can cause the meat to become tough and dry.Subscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt---------------------------------------------------------------PREP: 15 MINS TOTAL TIME: 1  HOUR 15 MINSSERVINGS:8INGREDIENTS1/2 cup milk4 slices white sandwich bread, torn into pieces1 1/2 pounds ground sirloin1 1/2 pounds ground pork2 small onions, finely chopped6 garlic cloves, minced1/2 cup chili sauce, plus 1/4 cup for glaze1 cup chopped fresh parsley1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese2 large eggs, lightly beatenCoarse salt and ground pepperCOOK'S NOTEFor a loaf with crisp edges, shape the meat mixture with your hands into a log slightly smaller than the pan. And for a light texture, don't press the log into the pan; just drop it in.DIRECTIONSSTEP 1Preheat oven to 350 degrees, with rack in center. In a large bowl, pour milk over bread; let soak, about 30 seconds. Add sirloin, pork, onion, garlic, 1/2 cup chili sauce, parsley, Parmesan, eggs, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Using your hands, mix until combined; do not overmix or meatloaf will be dense.STEP 2Divide mixture in half. Gently pat each half into a log, and place each log in an 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Do not press down or into corners.STEP 3Bake 50 minutes. Brush tops of loaves with remaining 1/4 cup chili sauce; continue cooking until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 160 degrees, about 10 minutes.STEP 4Remove from oven; let rest 5 minutes.

Today, I'm doubling the flavor of my cooked oats by baking them in the oven with pecans and bananas. This breakfast is seriously filling -- it has tons of fiber, fruit, and protein -- so a bowl of it will keep you energized for hours. Make it this weekend and see for yourself!Sarah's Tip of the Day: Dry-roasting raw nuts in a 350-degree oven will give them a richer flavor.

It's a savory prosciutto tart that's layered with sweet grape tomatoes and a just-set baked egg. These flaky squares are not only gorgeous to look at but they're dead simple to prepare (store-bought puff pastry makes this recipe a cinch to arrange). You can also easily increase this recipe just by rolling out another pastry sheet. Give your meat-and-potatoes meals a break and try these delicate treats for dinner instead.Sarah's Tip of the Day: Make quick work of halving cherry tomatoes by placing them between two plastic lids and slicing them down the center.

The dish is hearty but still feels light, which means it's the ideal meal for these between-seasons days.

Today, I'll be making tangy and fresh fish tacos -- and preparing them right on the stove.Sarah's Tip of the Day: This recipe calls for tilapia, which will sizzle alongside a jalapeno in your pan (it gives the oil some serious spice!). While that's cooking, you'll make a slaw from shredded red cabbage, jalapeno, and scallions, before tossing your vegetables in a dressing of low-fat sour cream and lime juice. Scoop some of the slaw into a taco before adding your cooked fish and cilantro. Could this be the most fantastic (and grill-free) summer dinner you've ever made? I think so!Subscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt---------------------------------------------------------------Serves 4`Ingredients:1 pound boneless, skinless tilapia fillets, cut into 2-inch pieces2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oilCoarse salt and ground pepper1/4 cup sour cream1 lime, half finely zested and juiced, half cut into wedgesHot sauce, such as Tabasco12 corn tortillas1/2 small head red cabbage, thinly sliced1 cup fresh cilantro1 small white onion, finely choppedDirections:Heat broiler, with rack in highest position.

Minced and sauteed in the base for a sauce, they simply add deep, savory flavor (not a hint of fishiness). Case in point: this delicious Italian puttanesca sauce. Sarah's Tip of the Day: Today's recipe calls for pork chops, and it's super easy. You'll brown your chops in a large skillet, then remove them before making your sauce from chopped garlic, capers, canned plum tomatoes, kalamata olives, and -- yes! -- anchovies. The flavors will begin to develop as soon as your ingredients hit the pan, so make sure to have everything prepped before getting started. After the sauce cooks for a few minutes, add your pork chops back to the skillet and finish the whole dish in the oven.

If you're lucky enough to have leftovers, the tabbouleh will be excellent the next day.Subscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt---------------------------------------------------------------Prep Time: 15 minutesTotal Time:1 hourServes 4Ingredients:3 pints cherry or grape tomatoes1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, dividedSalt and pepper1 cup coarse bulgur1 medium red onion, cut crosswise into thin slices1 can (15.5 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and drained2 bunches parsley, roughly chopped (1 1/2 to 2 cups)Lemon juice, plus wedges for servingDirections:Preheat oven to 450 degrees with racks in middle and lower thirds.

People are often intimidated by the idea of making curry at home, but despite the deep, exotic flavors, all the ingredients are available at any grocery store! You can vary the heat\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI like medium to hot curry powder, but if you use mild, this is a great recipe for introducing new flavors to kids.Sarah's Tip of the Day: And there's nothing complicated about the technique: Just coat chicken breasts in flour and brown them in oil. Make a sauce with vegetables by cooking onion, garlic, curry powder, potatoes, water, and tomatoes. Spoon everything over rice, and if you like, serve fun garnishes like plain yogurt, mango chutney, almonds, and raisins at the table.Subscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt---------------------------------------------------------------Prep Time: 20 minutesTotal Time: 45 minutesServes 4Ingredients:2 tablespoons all-purpose flour4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (6 ounces each)1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons olive oil1 medium onion, finely chopped (3/4 cup)2 cloves garlic, minced2 teaspoons medium to hot curry powderCoarse salt3/4 pound small red potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch chunks1 can (14 1/2 ounces) diced tomatoes (preferably zesty flavored), with juice1/4 cup waterDirections:Place flour on a plate.

Chicken or veal piccata served over pasta with fresh spinach\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit's just the kind of thing I would order at an Italian restaurant. But it's so easy to make at home (and easy on the wallet, too).Sarah's Tip of the Day: The cutlets cook in the time it takes to boil pasta. So once you get your linguine into boiling water, coat chicken or veal cutlets in flour and saute them in olive oil. Then make a simple pan sauce with white wine, lemon juice, butter, and capers. Throw some spinach into the pasta water, and drain it. Serve the pasta with the cutlets on top, so everything is coated with the rich, tangy sauce.

Place flour in a shallow bowl. Season cutlets with salt and pepper, then dip into flour, turning to coat; shake off excess.In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high. Add half the chicken; cook until lightly browned and opaque throughout, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate; cover with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining tablespoon oil and chicken (reserve skillet for sauce).Meanwhile, cook linguine in boiling water until al dente, according to package instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water. Add spinach, and stir until submerged. Drain pasta mixture and return to pot. Toss with 1 tablespoon butter; season generously with salt and pepper. Add some reserved pasta water if necessary. Cover to keep warm.Into skillet, pour wine and lemon juice. Cook over medium-high, stirring to loosen browned bits, until liquid has reduced to 1/3 cup, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat; swirl in 2 remaining tablespoons butter until melted. (For a smoother sauce, strain through a fine-mesh sieve, if desired.) Add capers, and season with salt and pepper. Divide chicken and linguine among four serving plates; top chicken with sauce.Cook's Note:Capers are often packed in brine.

Either way, this recipe is sure to satisfy.Sarah's Tip of the Day: Start with a good homemade broth (or use your favorite store-bought...I won't tell!). Then make the matzo balls by mixing some fat (skimmed from the top of your broth) or oil, chicken broth, egg yolks, salt and pepper, and seltzer water with some matzo meal. Then fold in some whipped egg whites. With the air-filled egg whites and the bubbly seltzer, these will be some of the fluffiest, most tender matzo balls ever! You cook them in salted water, then serve them with sliced carrots in chicken broth and some dill on top. Do you have your own matzo-ball-soup secrets? Share them with me on Facebook!

When I asked you what type of dishes you wanted to see me make for Reader Request Week, so many of you asked for French macarons. These sweet sandwich cookies have the reputation of being difficult to make, but I'm going to show you the easy way!Sarah's Tip of the Day: Instead of flour, these cookies are made with almond meal and confectioners sugar. Egg whites whipped with granulated sugr and almond extract give it that crisp-yet-chewy texture and nice, delicate flavor.

Yep, it's Reader Request Week here at Everyday Food: You wrote in on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, and now I'm whipping up the dishes you wanted to see me make. Plenty of you asked for lightened-up comfort-food recipes and foods with \"hidden\" veggies that even picky eaters would like. This mac and cheese fits the bill!Sarah's Tip of the Day: The base is pasta mixed with broccoli florets (there's your hidden veggie) and the sauce is made from olive oil, onion, ground mustard, flour, and a lighter cheese trifecta: Neufchatel, which is naturally low in fat, plus extra-sharp cheddar and grated Parmesan, which are so flavorful you don't need to use that much. Some low-fat milk makes it creamy, while toasted panko breadcrumbs give the casserole a nice crunchy topping.

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta 3 minutes less than package instructions. Add broccoli and cook 3 minutes more. Drain.Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pan over medium-high. Add onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and ground mustard. Saute until onion is translucent, about 4 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add Neufchatel, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring until incorporated. Gradually whisk in milk, then bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in cheddar and Parmesan, then add pasta and broccoli. Season with salt and pepper.Transfer to an 8-inch square baking dish and bake until bubbling in center, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle with panko, and serve.Cook's NoteRecipe Makeover!A serving of mac and cheese can pack up to 800 calories and 40 grams of fat. We whittled those numbers way down by subbing 1% milk for whole and creamy Neufchatel for higher-fat cheeses. Broccoli adds substance and vitamins.---------------------------------------------------------------Get the Full Recipe: http://www.marthastewart.com/969073/l...Nutritional Info: per serv (makes 6): 453 cal; 20 g fat; 21 g protein; 45 g carb; 2 g fiberMore Pasta Recipes: http://full.sc/PeV7er ---------------------------------------------------------------Want more?

So, this week I'm going to be making crowd-pleasing, easy-to-serve food that's perfect for a watch party. Whether you're going to be watching the game or the newest episode of \"Downtown Abbey,\" well, that's up to you! Sarah's Tip of the Day: I'm starting with two awesome avocado-based dips. One is chunky, one is smooth, and both will make guacamole a distant memory at any party. For the Avocado and Feta Dip, you'll need avocados and feta (obviously), plus a scallion, a red bell pepper, some fresh dill, and lemon juice. To make the Avocado and White Bean Dip, you'll combine avocados with cannellini beans, garlic cloves, fresh parsley, white wine vinegar, and red pepper flakes. Watch the video, and I'll show you how to make BOTH of these dips (hey, you might just want two!).

It cooks in the time it takes for the spaghetti to boil. Sarah's Tip of the Day:In the video, I'll show you how to tell if your leeks are fresh and demonstrate how to get them super clean.
