Agriculture is only possible in Siberia without artificial irrigation today between 50\u00c2\u00b0 and 60\u00c2\u00b0 north. Finds from the Lower Paleolithic appear to be attested between east Kazakhstan and Altai. In the Upper Palaeolithic, by contrast, most remains are found in the Urals, in Altai, on the upper Yenissei, west of Lake Baikal and on the shore of the Laptev Sea. The Siberian Palaeolithic continues well into the European Mesolithic. In north Asia, the Neolithic, which was between 5500 and 3400 B.C. is mostly a chronological term, since there is no evidence for agriculture or even pastoralism in Siberia during the central European Neolithic. In the second half of the third millennium B.C., bronze working reached the cultures of western Siberia. In the middle Bronze Age, between 1800 and 1500 B.C., the west Siberian Andronovo culture expanded markedly to the east and even reached the Yenissei valley. ------------------------------------------Created with Camtasia Studio.Information and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

The Bailiwick of Jersey and Bailiwick of Guernsey are two British Crown dependencies in the English Channel, near the coast of Normandy. The Channel Islands were the only part of the British Isles to be occupied by the Wehrmacht during the war. On 15 June 1940, after the Allied defeat in France, the British government decided that the Channel Islands were of no strategic importance and had been demilitarised and declared an open town. A german reconnaissance pilot, Hauptmann Liebe-Pieteritz, made a test landing at Guernsey's deserted airfield on 30 June to determine the level of defence. He reported his brief landing to Luftflotte 3 which came to the decision that the islands were not defended. A platoon of Luftwaffe airmen was flown that evening to Guernsey by Junkers transport planes.As part of the Atlantic Wall, between 1940 and 1945 the occupying German forces and the Organisation Todt constructed fortifications, roads and other facilities in the Channel Islands. The German occupation of 1940 - 1945 was harsh. Over 2,000 Islanders were deported by the Germans, and some Jews were sent to concentration camps. During June 1944 Allied Forces decided to bypass the Channel Islands due to their heavy fortifications. The Channel Islands were liberated after the German surrender on 8 May 1945. ------------------------------------------Created with Camtasia Studio.Information and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

British attempts to seize the munitions of Massachusetts colonists in April 1775 led to the first open combat between Crown forces and Massachusetts militia, the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775.  The Continental Congress appointed George Washington to take command of the militia. Later he was appointed as commander-in-chief of the newly formed Continental Army, as well as coordinating state militia units.On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress formally voted for independence, issuing its Declaration on July 4. Washington captured a Hessian force at Trenton and drove the British out of New Jersey, restoring American confidence. British general, Burgoyne outran his supplies, was surrounded and surrendered at Saratoga in October 1777. In 1778 France formally entered the war, signing a military alliance that recognized the independence of the United States. In 1781, after the British and their allies had suffered two decisive defeats at King's Mountain in October 1780 and Cowpens in January 1781, Cornwallis retreated to Virginia, intending on evacuation. A joint Franco-American army led by Count Rochambeau and Washington, laid siege to the British forces at Yorktown. With no sign of relief and the situation untenable, Cornwallis surrendered in October 1781.On September 3, 1783, the combatants signed the Treaty of Paris, ending the war. Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States over the territory bounded roughly by present-day Canada to the north, by Florida to the south, and by the Mississippi River to the west.------------------------------------------Created with Camtasia Studio.Information and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

Concrete-like materials were used since 6500 B.C. by the Nabataea traders or Bedouins who occupied and controlled a series of oases and developed a small empire in the regions of southern Syria and northern Jordan. The earliest large-scale users of concrete technology were the ancient Romans, and concrete was widely used in the Roman Empire. During the Roman Empire, Roman concrete (or opus caementicium) was made from quicklime, pozzolana and an aggregate of pumice. In 1824 Joseph Aspdin invented the modern Portland cement. He named his cement Portland, after a rock quary that produced very strong stone. In 1849 Joseph Monier invented the reinforced concrete. In 1930, air entraining agents were used for the first time in concrete to resist against damage from freezing and thawing.------------------------------------------Created with Camtasia Studio.Information and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

The empire was lead at the time of the sack by emperor Honorius, son of Emperor Theodosius who died in 395.On August 24, 410, the Visigoths entered Rome through its Salarian Gate, according to some opened by treachery, according to others by want of food, and pillaged the city for three days. Because the barbarians had converted to Christian sect Arianism, it was not a particularly violent looting with relatively little rape, murder and damage to buildings.This was the first time Rome had been sacked in 800 years, after this was done by Gallic tribes led by Brennus in 390 BC.

Both the socialist and the conservative camp possessed their own paramilitary forces. The conservatives began organising the Heimwehr (or Homeguard) in 1921. In response, the Social Democrats organised paramilitaries called the Republikanischer Schutzbund (or Republican Protection Association) after 1923.On 4 March 1933, Christian Social Chancellor Engelbert Dolfuss suspended the Austrian Parliament. On 12 February 1934, a force, led by Heimwehr commander in Vienna, Emil Fey, searched Hotel Schiff in Linz, a property belonging to the Social Democratic Party. Linz Schutzbund commander Richard Bernaschek was the first to actively resist, sparking off armed conflict between a conglomeration of the Heimwehr, the police, the gendarmerie and the regular Federal Army against the outlawed, but still existent, socialist Schutzbund. Skirmishes between the two camps spread to other cities and towns in Austria, with the heat of the action occurring in Vienna. Dollfuss ordered Karl-Marx-Hof shelled with light artillery, endangering the lives of thousands of civilians and destroying many flats before forcing the socialist fighters to surrender. ------------------------------------------Created with Camtasia Studio.Information and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

The Norse, who had settled Greenland and Iceland, arrived around the year 1000 and built a small settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows, at the northernmost tip of Newfoundland. John Cabot became the first European known to have landed in Canada after the time of the Vikings. Based on the Treaty of Tordesillas, the Spanish Crown claimed it had territorial rights in the area visited by John Cabot in 1497 and 1498.  However, Portuguese explorers like Jo\u00c3\u00a3o Fernandes Lavrador would continue to visited the north Atlantic coast, which accounts for the appearance of \"Labrador\" on topographical maps of the period.French interest in the New World began with Francis I of France, who in 1524 sponsored Giovanni da Verrazzano to navigate the region between Florida and Newfoundland in hopes of finding a route to the Pacific Ocean. In 1534, Jacques Cartier planted a cross in the Gasp\u00c3\u00a9 Peninsula and claimed the land in the name of Francis I. On 3 July 1608 Samuel de Champlain founded what is now Quebec City, probably the earliest permanent settlement in present-day Canada , which would become the capital of New France.------------------------------------------Created with Camtasia Studio.Information and images are Creative Commons from Wikipedia pages.

These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites in the Levant, although wheat was the first to be grown and harvested on a significant scale. At around the same time (9400 BC), parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated.---------------------------------------------------------------This video is extracted from 36 lectures  course called \"The Big History of Civilizations\" instructed by Professor Craig G.

The Flavians rose to power during the civil war of 69, known as the Year of the Four Emperors. After Galba and Otho died in quick succession, Vitellius became emperor in mid 69. His claim to the throne was quickly challenged by legions stationed in the Eastern provinces, who declared their commander Vespasian emperor in his place. The Second Battle of Bedriacum tilted the balance decisively in favour of the Flavian forces, who entered Rome on December 20. The following day, the Roman Senate officially declared Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire, thus commencing the Flavian dynasty.--------------------------This video is extracted from 48 lectures course called \"History of the Ancient World - A Global Perspective\" instructed by Professor Gregory S.

Few gladiators survived more than 10 contests, though one survived an extraordinary 150 bouts; and another died at 90 years of age, presumably long after retirement.A natural death following retirement is also likely for three individuals who died at 38, 45, and 48 years respectively.George Ville, using evidence from 1st century gladiator headstones, calculated an average age at death of 27, and mortality \"among all who entered the arena\" at 19/100. Marcus Junkelmann disputes Ville's calculation for average age at death; the majority would have received no headstone, and would have died early in their careers, at 18\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25 years of age.Between the early and later Imperial periods the risk of death for defeated gladiators rose from 1/5 to 1/4, perhaps because missio was granted less often.Hopkins and Beard tentatively estimate a total of 400 arenas throughout the Roman Empire at its greatest extent, with a combined total of 8,000 deaths per annum from executions, combats and accidents.---------------------------This video is extract from 36 Lectures course called \"Classical Archaeology of Ancient Greece and Rome\" taught by professor John R HaleFor more information Please visit https://www.thegreatcourses.com/cours...",

He was also able to make peace with the Illyrians who had threatened his borders.Philip II spent his initial years radically transforming the Macedonian army. A reform of its organization, equipment, and training, including the introduction of the Macedonian phalanx armed with long pikes (i.e. the sarissa), proved immediately successful when tested against his Illyrian and Paeonian enemies.Confusing accounts in ancient sources have led modern scholars to debate how much Philip II's royal predecessors may have contributed to these reforms and the extent to which his ideas were influenced by his adolescent years of captivity in Thebes as a political hostage during the Theban hegemony, especially after meeting with the general Epaminondas-------------------------------This video is extracted from 35 Lectures course called \"Ancient Empires before Alexander\" instructed by Professor Robert L.

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused.---------------------------------This video is extracted from 48 lectures course called \"History of the Ancient World - A Global Perspective\" instructed by Professor Gregory S.

During the preceding three centuries, Babylonia had been ruled by their fellow Akkadian speakers and northern neighbours, Assyria. A year after the death of the last strong Assyrian ruler, Assurbanipal, in 627 BC, the Assyrian empire spiralled into a series of brutal civil wars. Babylonia rebelled under Nabopolassar. In alliance with the Medes, Persians, Scythians and Cimmerians, they sacked the city of Nineveh in 612 BC, and the seat of empire was transferred to Babylonia for the first time since the death of Hammurabi in the mid 18th century BC. This period witnessed a general improvement in economic life and agricultural production, and a great flourishing of architectural projects, the arts and science.The Neo-Babylonian period ended with the reign of Nabonidus in 539 BC.

We also look at the role of Germany as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcqueen of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the extent to which she is responsible for developments in southern European countries.While the rise of far right may seem unthinkable, dramatic scenes of racially motivated blood shed on the streets of Athens, police brutality linked to membership of far-right organisations and institutional racism in Greece tell a different story. Meanwhile, in Germany a more subtle, insidious message reaches the public with headlines blaming \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclazy Greeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and other minorities within the country.

Patagonia is not only a region of breath-taking beauty and vast natural resources, but also the region where, some people believe, a new Jewish state could be created. Those who believe that the writings of Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, have been distorted reject this theory. In his book The Jewish State, published in 1897 Herzl talks about the need to create a nation for Jews, and talked about two possible sites: Argentina and Palestine. This fascinating documentary visits Patagonia and speaks to important representatives of the Jewish community as well as critics of Zionism in Argentina and Chile. Plan Andinia poses an important question: Is the creation of a Jewish state in Patagonia a conspiracy theory or a real possibility?Distributed by Sideways FilmsTo be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to Reel Truth History, the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

He also highlights some recently released information about German pharmaceutical giant Gr\u00c3\u00bcnenthal, who aggressively marketed the drug, and are now selling it again under a different usage, but still with no compensation for those who's lives they affected so deeply. The indefatigable spirit of the extraordinary thalidomide victims is cast against the callousness disregard of the drug's manufacturers in a film that lays out the story from it's beginnings in the late 50s to the current state of affairs in the present day.Distributed by Sideways FilmsTo be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to Reel Truth History, the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

While relatives mourn the victims, attention turns to the arrival of the Pope five days later, a PR agency is hired to sweep the incident under the carpet and within a month the case is closed.Faced with a media blackout and a wall-of-silence from the government, a small group of families of the victims led by Beatriz Garrote begin what at first appears to be a hopeless cause \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to find the truth about what happened that fateful day and seek justice for those who died.The Strategy of Silence chronicles their 9 year struggle, and along the way exposes government corruption, mass safety breaches, a cynical culture of cover-ups and both a media and judiciary in thrall to government officials.From nothing the protests grow until they can no longer be ignored, Beatriz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s band of bereaved campaigners first take over their local television station and finally reach the European Parliament. They are granted an independent investigation vindicating their entire struggle and finally leading to the downfall of the leading PP party.The Strategy of Silence is an inspiring under-dog story, that showcases government capacity for deception and abuse, but also the power that we as citizens can \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with courage and tenacity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c take back.Distributed by Sideways FilmsTo be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to Reel Truth History, the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

Not surprisingly, gun violence has become one of the most urgent public health issues facing Americans today.In 91%, a cross-section of U.S. gun violence victims tell their heartbreaking stories of loss, pain, and a heroic search for hope in a nation stalled in a senseless gun control debate. Throughout these otherwise unrelated shootings, we find a common thread \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the gunmen had all-too- easy access to the virtually untraceable, high-powered weaponry used in their attacks.In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, a 2013 poll revealed that 91% of Americans support comprehensive background checks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a factor that could prevent thousands of similar gun violence tragedies nationwide. Yet, divisive political rhetoric and congressional gridlock continues to perpetuate a flawed system that hurts communities across the country.Moving beyond the confusing gun control politics and avoiding any discussion about the often-unpredictable motivations of rampage killers, 91% shows that Americans almost unanimously support both 2nd amendment rights and common sense regulation. The film finds a shared language between citizens on both sides of the issue, encouraging them to move common sense policy forward by speaking up in a conversation typically dominated by firearm lobbyists and manufacturers.By highlighting the impact of unregulated gun sales on schools, families, and communities across the country, 91% addresses the real problems and possible solutions to gun violence in America.

Their members are aging and the government of Japan has launched a large-scale crackdown on them to eradicate them once and for all. But who are the Yakuza? The cancer of a nation or a necessary evil in a country with one of the lowest crime rates in the industrialised world?Undoubtedly the Yakuza are involved in crimes including extortion, fraud, murder, drugs & gambling. However, Japan has one of the lowest crime rates in the industrialised world, with crimes related to drugs -officially against the Yakuza code of honour- or street gangs strikingly low, a fact that many contribute to the presence of the Yakuza. Deeply rooted in Japanese society, they are seen as a necessary evil and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproblem solvers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. They have been around since the 1700s and were said to protect the weak from the strong, following a rigorous code of honour. Several clans even contributed aid for the victims of the recent earthquake and Tsunami, all reasons why the public perception of the Yakuza in Japan is not solely a negative one.Unlike the Mafia, the Yakuza is a legal, public group making them relatively easy to check on. Their offices are public, their members registered by the police and Yakuza members went as far as freely admitting their guilt in cases of crime investigations, as a part of their code of honour. In reaction to strict government measures against them, the Yakuza has ceased all cooperation with the law. As the police concentrate their resources on the Yakuza, many criminals simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t register with clans anymore and start operating underground, evading the grasp of police. A clear trend is emerging towards a new structure of organised crime in Japan, resulting in a steep decrease in the numbers of the traditional Yakuza while the underground is soaring \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including foreign Russian and Chinese mafia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.This documentary deals with the struggle of the Yakuza for its survival and the restructuring of the organized crime scene in Japan. Furthermore, unprecedented access to the secret world of the Yakuza gives you an insight on who the Yakuza really are: criminals, outcasts, but also family men and a part of Japanese society.Distributed by Sideways FilmsTo be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to Reel Truth History, the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

            "description": "This gripping film tells the humorous yet heroic story of how a crumbling, Cold-War era Vulcan plane flew the then longest range bombing mission in history and how a WW2 vintage bomb changed the outcome of the Falklands War. On 30th April 1982, the RAF launched a secret mission; to bomb Port Stanley's runway, putting it out of action for Argentine fighter jets. The safety of the British Task Force depended on its success. But the RAF could only get a single Vulcan 8,000 miles south to the Falklands as just one bomber needed an aerial fleet of thirteen Victor tanker planes to refuel it throughout the 16 hour round-trip. From start to finish, the seemingly impossible mission was a comedy of errors, held together by sheer British pluck and ingenuity. On the brink of being scrapped, only three of the ageing nuclear bombers could be fitted out for war, one to fly the mission and two in reserve. Crucial spare parts were scavenged from museums and scrap yards - one vital piece found as an ashtray in the Officer's Mess. In just three weeks, the Vulcan crews had to learn air-to-air refuelling, which they hadn't done for twenty years and conventional bombing, which they hadn't done for ten. The RAF scoured the country for old WW2 iron bombs and complex refuelling calculations were done the night before on a \u00c2\u00a35.00 pocket calculator. With a plan stretched to the limit and the RAF's hopes riding on just one Vulcan, the mission was flown on a knife-edge; fraught with mechanical failures, unreliable navigation, electrical storms and ultimately not enough fuel. Of the Vulcan's twenty-one bombs dropped, only one found its target. But that was enough to change the outcome of the war...To be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to Reel Truth History, the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

This is the remarkable, precarious, and untold story of a lost herd of elephants that live near the fabled city of Timbuktu. How the elephants survive in this seemingly barren, desolate landscape is a mystery. It is one however that Anne Orlando, a biologist from the University of California, hopes to unravel. For the first time she will track the elephants to uncharted lands and reveal the relationship they have with Tuareg nomads - a relationship which can be both respectful, and bloody. The lost elephants of Timbuktu are completely isolated from other African elephants - they were cut off from each other as the Sahara turned to desert centuries ago. They have survived in this unlikely setting by having a mental map of scattered temporary lakes and marshes. This is the Sahel in the West African state of Mali - one of the most arid places on earth and becoming more so. As drought has intensified over time, the elephants' wanderings between these vital watering holes have stretched into a remarkable yearly migration of seven hundred miles. The Sahel is changing fast - the climate is becoming drier and many Tuareg people are abandoning their herds and establishing sedentary homes around the traditional waterholes of the elephants. This, unfortunately, can only lead to conflict. The Lost Elephants Of Timbuktu will be an unforgettable adventure into a lost world.To be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to Reel Truth History, the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

Compiling evidence from both historic sources and new technologies point to the correct location in this seismic, revelatory new film.In this startling and original documentary, writer and historian, Dan Gibson, shows that descriptions of Mohamed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original holy city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as detailed in the Qur\u00e2\u20ac\u2122an and Islamic histories, do not match that of the Mecca we know today.  If true this could shake Islam to it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roots, because every Muslim is required to pray towards  the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforbidden gathering place\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. If Dan Gibson is right, Muslims are praying in the wrong direction.In the film \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Sacred City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 we set out his evidence from within Islamic and ancient histories \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while also using modern technologies -  to track down the biggest secret of the last fifteen hundred years. Gibson not only finds the location of the original Mecca but also provides a convincing argument as to how such a great misunderstanding in Islamic history came about.While clearly controversial, The Sacred City is respectful of Islam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prophet, and does not dispute the events of the Qur\u00e2\u20ac\u2122an; but shows how a deliberate attempt was made to hide from Islam, secrets that impact every Muslim today. The evidence is compelling and fascinating.In a time when the world agenda is being set by Islam, it is more important than ever for the origins and history of this world religion to be examined afresh. This is an important documentary with world-wide appeal for both religious and secular audiences.Beautifully filmed in the ruins and deserts of the middle east, the film is a detective story that investigates the dawn of Islam and will become the most talked about film for years to come.Distributed by Sideways FilmsTo be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to Reel Truth History, the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

Napoleon decided to strangle his remaining enemy the United Kingdom economically by enacting Europe-wide Colonial Blockade, yet as Portugal defied him, he invaded it and then Spain. This was the beginning of the Peninsular War. Soon Spain and Portugal were in open rebellion. The first phase of the war ended when the British forces under Wellington landed in Portugal and fought the French General Junot at Vimeiro.You can watch the first season via this link, it covers Trafalgar, Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau, Friedland and other battles: http://bit.ly/2Men3Z7This script was researched and written by Everett Rummage.

During one of them, the Gallic Senones led by their king Brennus defeated the Romans at Allia and then sacked the city.

In a small civil conflict between two political parties in the smallest country in the region, Uruguay, the greatest war in South American history was sparked.

Throughout history, control of the strategic Island of Cyprus has proved critical for any desiring naval supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean. For Ptolemy and the Antigonids it was no different. Six years after his humiliating defeat at Gaza, Demetrius and Ptolemy's forces would clash once again off the east coast of this island - each vying for its control. This battle, dubbed the Battle of Salamis, would be the greatest naval battle of the Wars, with its result having far-reaching consequences. In this episode, we shall cover the Babylonian War and the rise of Seleucus, the execution of Alexander's family and the end of the Argead dynasty and other events leading up to this great battle as well as the climactic engagement itself.The script was developed and narrated by our good friend Tristan Hughes.

With the addition of dozens of other tribes, the battle of the Catalaunian Plains can be rightly considered the first pan-European clash. It is equally complicated and controversial, as our info on the battle between the Last Roman Aetius and the Scourge of God Attila, is both limited and conflicting.

The concentration of the Soviet troops around the Kursk salient offered that opportunity and Hitler ordered the operation Citadel with a goal of cutting the salient and surrounding the Red Army forces defending it. This would be one of the last German offensives on the Eastern Front and would culminate at the arguably biggest tank battle in history - Prokhorovka and Soviet counter-attacks during the operations Rumyantsev and Kutuzov.

The Ostrogoths besieged the city in 537, but Belisarius survived a year-long siege. With new forces in the area, the things were looking bright for the Roman Empire, but soon Belisarius lost the confidence of Justinian and entered into a conflict with another commander - Narses. All that, the Sassanid attack in the East, the start of the Justinian's Plague and invasion of Italy by the Franks prolonged the Gothic War. The conflict would culminate at the battles of Taginae and Volturnus.Previous videos within this series - Battle of Dara 530: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GR_V...Battle of Ad Decimum 533: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP7zb...Siege of Rome 537-538Support us on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/KingsandGenerals or Paypal: http://paypal.me/kingsandgeneralsWe are grateful to our patrons and sponsors, who made this video possible: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u...The script was developed by our friend Philip Binns.

Carthage, Seleucids, Macedon, Greek Leagues, a number of Gallic and Celtiberian tribes were defeated, and it seemed that Rome is invincible. However, the economic and political situation in the Republic was degrading, and the rivalry between the patricians and the plebes reached its peak. It was then, in 113 BC Rome was attacked by the Germanic tribes for the first time. The Cimbri and Teutoni moved from Jutland and Germania and raided the Roman territory. After a number of defeats, among them at the battle of Arausio - which was the worst since Hannibal, Republic has found a new savior in Gaius Marius. This brilliant general reformed the legions and defeated the Germanic tribes at the battles of Aquae Sextae in 102 BC and Vercellae in 101 BC to end this threat. Although Marian Reform was essential for the future conquests, it also planted the seeds of the future civil wars and gave the opportunity to Sulla and Caesar to end the Republic.Support us on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/KingsandGenerals or Paypal: http://paypal.me/kingsandgeneralsWe are grateful to our patrons and sponsors, who made this video possible: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S...This video was narrated by Officially Devin (https://www.youtube.com/user/Official...)Machinimas for the video made on the Total War: Rome 2 Engine by  Malay Archer (https://www.youtube.com/user/Mathemed...)\u00e2\u0153\u201d Merch store \u00e2\u2013\u00ba https://teespring.com/stores/kingsand...\u00e2\u0153\u201d Patreon \u00e2\u2013\u00ba https://www.patreon.com/KingsandGenerals\u00e2\u0153\u201d PayPal \u00e2\u2013\u00ba http://paypal.me/kingsandgenerals\u00e2\u0153\u201d Twitch \u00e2\u2013\u00ba https://www.twitch.tv/nurrrik_phoenix\u00e2\u0153\u201d Twitter \u00e2\u2013\u00ba https://twitter.com/KingsGenerals\u00e2\u0153\u201d Facebook \u00e2\u2013\u00ba https://www.facebook.com/KingsGenerals\u00e2\u0153\u201d Instagram \u00e2\u2013\u00bahttp://www.instagram.com/Kings_GeneralsInspired by: BazBattles, Invicta (THFE), Epic History TV, Historia Civilis and Time CommandersProduction Music courtesy of Epidemic Sound: http://www.epidemicsound.comSongs used:",

            "description": "Napoleon, upon ascending to First Consul of France in 1799, had inherited a chaotic republic; he subsequently created a state with stable finances, a strong bureaucracy, and a well-trained army. In 1805, Austria and Russia waged war against France. In response, Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz in December 1805, which is considered his greatest victory. At sea, the British inflicted a severe defeat in the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805 upon the joint Franco-Spanish navy, securing British control of the seas and preventing the invasion of Britain itself. Prussian concerns about increasing French power led to a resumption of war in October 1806. Napoleon quickly defeated the Prussians, and defeated Russia in June 1807, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent.

Although we tried to keep it factual, some approximation was made to simplify and show the events prior to the Cristopher Nolan movie Dunkirk. Phoenix watched the movie on Thursday and thought that this video will be helpful to those who are not familiar with the events of the Battle of France, Battle of Belgium, Battle of Dunkirk and Operation Dynamo. Obviously, we would love to produce videos on the II World War and other modern wars, and we will do so if this video gets enough interest.

We decided to start with Ancient Greeks, as the evolution of their warfare seems very interesting, especially since historians agree that Greeks and the way they fought set up the dominance of the Western civilization for the next 2,5 thousand years. We start with the Mycenaean Civilization and continue with the invasion of the Sea Peoples and the Dorians into the Dark Age and then the early polis period and the Agrarian Warfare, and discuss Homer's Iliad along the way.
