                "description": "After the fall of the Qing dynasty China fell apart and both, forces loyal to Chiang Kais-shek's National Kuomintang Party and as Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China, fought to rule the country. This bloody struggle would ultimately result in the Chinese Civil War. It would take more than 22 years but would come to a halt during the 2nd Sino-Japanese War. After Japan's defeat, Mao's troops grew strong quickly and soon after they were able to force Chiang Kai-shek and his followers out of China. They sought refuge in Taiwan. Shortly after, Mao Zedong called out the People's Republic of China.

                    "description": "After the fall of the Qing dynasty China fell apart and both, forces loyal to Chiang Kais-shek's National Kuomintang Party and as Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China, fought to rule the country. This bloody struggle would ultimately result in the Chinese Civil War. It would take more than 22 years but would come to a halt during the 2nd Sino-Japanese War. After Japan's defeat, Mao's troops grew strong quickly and soon after they were able to force Chiang Kai-shek and his followers out of China. They sought refuge in Taiwan. Shortly after, Mao Zedong called out the People's Republic of China.

                "description": "The oppression of the Chinese people during the first half of the Century of Humiliation increased unrest in the country. More and more revolutionary groups formed and tried to destroy the ruling Qing dynasty. The Qing would finally fall by 1912, and because Sun Yat-sen had passed on his role as the new president of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai took power. Later however Sun Yat-sen's Chinese National Party Kuomintang would try to overthrow Yuan's Beiyang government and unify the country. The Kuomintang defeated the Beiyang government in 1928 under its new anti-Communist leader Chiang Kai-shek. Reuniting China would have to wait until after the Second World War had ended. It would be the Communist leader Mao Zedong who would, on October 1 1949, declare the People's Republic of China.

                    "description": "The oppression of the Chinese people during the first half of the Century of Humiliation increased unrest in the country. More and more revolutionary groups formed and tried to destroy the ruling Qing dynasty. The Qing would finally fall by 1912, and because Sun Yat-sen had passed on his role as the new president of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai took power. Later however Sun Yat-sen's Chinese National Party Kuomintang would try to overthrow Yuan's Beiyang government and unify the country. The Kuomintang defeated the Beiyang government in 1928 under its new anti-Communist leader Chiang Kai-shek. Reuniting China would have to wait until after the Second World War had ended. It would be the Communist leader Mao Zedong who would, on October 1 1949, declare the People's Republic of China.

                "description": "The Boxer Rebellion was one of China's biggest uprisings against the unwanted European, US-American and Japanese Imperialism. Distrust and tensions marked all contacts with foreigners. Secret societies were formed to propagate against the enemy. The Yihequan, also known as Boxers, quickly rose to one of the biggest organisations in Northern China. Masters of close combat, they mainly targeted converted Chinese Christians and attacks increased wildly in the 1880s. From 1900 Empress Dowager Cixi was less and less opposed to the Rebellion, as she hoped to fight back foreign influence. Shortly after, even the Chinese Army started helping the rebels and foreigners were fought, killed or driven out. Consequently, an alliance of the imperial powers sent in 50.000 soldiers to end the massacre. Tough reprisals and treaties followed.

                    "description": "The Boxer Rebellion was one of China's biggest uprisings against the unwanted European, US-American and Japanese Imperialism. Distrust and tensions marked all contacts with foreigners. Secret societies were formed to propagate against the enemy. The Yihequan, also known as Boxers, quickly rose to one of the biggest organisations in Northern China. Masters of close combat, they mainly targeted converted Chinese Christians and attacks increased wildly in the 1880s. From 1900 Empress Dowager Cixi was less and less opposed to the Rebellion, as she hoped to fight back foreign influence. Shortly after, even the Chinese Army started helping the rebels and foreigners were fought, killed or driven out. Consequently, an alliance of the imperial powers sent in 50.000 soldiers to end the massacre. Tough reprisals and treaties followed.

                "description": "The Opium War started as a dispute over trading rights between China and Great Britain. Regular trade between Europe and the Chinese had been ongoing for centuries. But China's trading restrictions frustrated the British who were eager to supply the Chinese people with the increasingly popular narcotic Opium. Circumventing the government's attempts to ban opium trade by smuggling and bribery, China declared the death sentence on Opium smuggling and refused to compensate British tradesmen for any losses. Furiously, the Brits sent out a fleet to demand compensation and end the Cohong trading monopoly. Fierce battles and attacks on the Chinese coast were followed.

                    "description": "The Opium War started as a dispute over trading rights between China and Great Britain. Regular trade between Europe and the Chinese had been ongoing for centuries. But China's trading restrictions frustrated the British who were eager to supply the Chinese people with the increasingly popular narcotic Opium. Circumventing the government's attempts to ban opium trade by smuggling and bribery, China declared the death sentence on Opium smuggling and refused to compensate British tradesmen for any losses. Furiously, the Brits sent out a fleet to demand compensation and end the Cohong trading monopoly. Fierce battles and attacks on the Chinese coast were followed.

The White Lotus Movement advocated progressive thinking in the time of the conservative Ming dynasty. In 1616 the Qing dynasty came to power. Also known as the Manchu dynasty, the Qing refused to open their borders to limitless trade which led to frustrated European merchants. This caused hostility and mistrust of the \"barbaric Chinese\". Shortly thereafter China's economy lost its race against European Colonialism and would lose military influence after gunpowder reached Europe.

Also known as \"Master Sun's Military Methods\", the book explains basics like the \"Strategy of Attack\", \"Moving the Army\" and even \"Employing Spies\" in 13 short chapters, restricting itselfs to general principles rather than detailed instructions of strategy and tactics.

But the fall would follow soon after the great rise of the Chinese Empire.

He soon would fall to his son Li Shimin, known as Taozong who quickly introduced many reforms. Expanding massively and increasing export, the Golden Age of China would beginn. But the fall would follow soon after the great rise of the Chinese Empire. Following a short interregnum by the first and only female Empress Wu Zetian, the beginning of the Second Tang Dynasty would at the same time usher the end of this influential period.

Little is known about his life and biography but his maxims have survived and to this days are practised in the religion of Confucianism.

                    "description": "Confucius is probably the best known Chinese philosopher of all times. Although he developed his theories about 2500 years ago, his ancient ideas of morality can still be applied today. He taught his philosophies of confucianism at his \"School of Ru\". Little is known about his life and biography but his maxims have survived and to this days are practised in the religion of Confucianism. His so-called five constants, made up of humanity, tradition, rectitude, scrupulousness and knowledge should help humanity become content and make the best out of their worldliness.

The Powerplay among and within these Chinese dynasties would continue throughout China's history. But intrigues and wars were often followed by eras of great prosperity and innovation. And so it is no wonder that things like the codification of law can be traced back to the dynasties at the Yellow River.

                    "description": "When you talk about the history of China, you have to go back in time starting in the Bronze Age which is the time of China's first dynasties: namely the Xia-, the Shang- and the Zhou-Dynasty. The Powerplay among and within these Chinese dynasties would continue throughout China's history. But intrigues and wars were often followed by eras of great prosperity and innovation. And so it is no wonder that things like the codification of law can be traced back to the dynasties at the Yellow River.

                "description": "A city that is not plastered with branches of US Fast Food chains is a rare sight nowadays. That wasn't always the case. Fast Food, as we know it today, is a child of the economic boom after World War 2. Taking your new car for a ride to the Drive-In restaurant and getting a fresh burger; that's the American Dream right there. Ultimately the concept of identical taste and identical manufacturing steps is one thing: pure capitalism. Food chains keep wages and costs as low as possible and that is why Fast Food is not nearly as glamorous today as it once was. So put down that Hamburger and find out all about the history of Fast Food with Guy on IT'S HISTORY. \n\nBig Mac Index: http://bit.ly/TheBIGMACIndex\n\n\u00bb The Complete PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/ColdWarPlaylist\n \n\u00bb Mentioned Videos:\n\nCold War Culture: http://bit.ly/ColdWar_X\n\nCounter Culture: http://bit.ly/BeatnikHippies\n\nInvention of the Car: http://bit.ly/AutoInvention\n\n\u00bb JOIN OUR COMMUNITY FOR MORE HISTORY KNOWLEDGE!\nWrite us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/ITSHISTORYfb\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/thehistoryshow\nYour photos on Instagram: https://instagram.com/itshistorychannel\n\n\u00bb Interested in the First World War?

                    "description": "A city that is not plastered with branches of US Fast Food chains is a rare sight nowadays. That wasn't always the case. Fast Food, as we know it today, is a child of the economic boom after World War 2. Taking your new car for a ride to the Drive-In restaurant and getting a fresh burger; that's the American Dream right there. Ultimately the concept of identical taste and identical manufacturing steps is one thing: pure capitalism. Food chains keep wages and costs as low as possible and that is why Fast Food is not nearly as glamorous today as it once was. So put down that Hamburger and find out all about the history of Fast Food with Guy on IT'S HISTORY. \n\nBig Mac Index: http://bit.ly/TheBIGMACIndex\n\n\u00bb The Complete PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/ColdWarPlaylist\n \n\u00bb Mentioned Videos:\n\nCold War Culture: http://bit.ly/ColdWar_X\n\nCounter Culture: http://bit.ly/BeatnikHippies\n\nInvention of the Car: http://bit.ly/AutoInvention\n\n\u00bb JOIN OUR COMMUNITY FOR MORE HISTORY KNOWLEDGE!\nWrite us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/ITSHISTORYfb\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/thehistoryshow\nYour photos on Instagram: https://instagram.com/itshistorychannel\n\n\u00bb Interested in the First World War?

When it came to her qualification for the Olympic Games in Mexico City 1968, she had to be tested to determine her biological sex. The tests results determined that Ewa was intersexual - she had an additional X-Chromosome. Her genetic mutation was then used by the West to publicly discredit her and she lost her records. \n\n\u00bb ALL VIDEOS on the Cold War: http://bit.ly/ColdWarPlaylist\n \n\u00bb Mentioned Videos:\n\nWeapons of Mass Destruction: http://bit.ly/WMDTCW\n\nCuba Crisis and Espionage: http://bit.ly/EspionageTCW\n\n\u00bb JOIN OUR COMMUNITY FOR MORE HISTORY KNOWLEDGE!\nWrite us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/ITSHISTORYfb\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/thehistoryshow\nYour photos on Instagram: https://instagram.com/itshistorychannel\n\n\u00bb Interested in the First World War?

That metaphor is actually based on the doomsday clock, an imaginary clock set up by scientists during the Cold War to remind us how close we were to mutually assured destruction. The East and the West both possessed enough Nuclear Weapons to kill the world in an atomic showdown, creating a constant battle for a balance of terror.

                "description": "It\u2019s hard to imagine what our world would be like today without the invention of the internet. What it means to our society can be answered in many ways. Based on a project of internet pioneer Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, the roots of our internet today are strongly grounded in the need for stable and secure means of communication during the Cold War. Not lastly thanks to the US, who worried that their centralized channels of communication and information could be destroyed by attacking enemies, established the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), focussing on developing alternative information networks. A system would soon be born under the watch of Joseph Licklider, that would be able to connect the world.

                    "description": "It\u2019s hard to imagine what our world would be like today without the invention of the internet. What it means to our society can be answered in many ways. Based on a project of internet pioneer Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, the roots of our internet today are strongly grounded in the need for stable and secure means of communication during the Cold War. Not lastly thanks to the US, who worried that their centralized channels of communication and information could be destroyed by attacking enemies, established the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), focussing on developing alternative information networks. A system would soon be born under the watch of Joseph Licklider, that would be able to connect the world. Check out this episode where Brett takes a look at how the internet became the ever present cultural phenomenon that it is today.\n\n\u00bb ALL VIDEOS on the Cold War: http://bit.ly/ColdWarPlaylist\n \n\u00bb The Invention of the Computer: http://bit.ly/TheComputer\n\n\u00bb JOIN OUR COMMUNITY FOR MORE HISTORY KNOWLEDGE!\nWrite us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/ITSHISTORYfb\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/thehistoryshow\nYour photos on Instagram: https://instagram.com/itshistorychannel\n\n\u00bb Interested in the First World War?

                    "description": "The agreements made late during World War 2 were soon to become obsolete when the USSR and the Allies couldn't agree on the economic future of Germany. After the US further alienated Joseph Stalin with the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, the decision was made to divide Germany. The Iron Curtain fell over Europe. East and West Germany would remain symbols of the balance of terror and completely opposite ideologies of the bipolar world during the Cold War for the next 40 years.\n\n\u00bb ALL VIDEOS on the Cold War: http://bit.ly/ColdWarPlaylist\n \n\u00bb Zero Hour - The Cold War Begins: http://bit.ly/ZeroHourTCW\n\n\u00bb JOIN OUR COMMUNITY FOR MORE HISTORY KNOWLEDGE!\nWrite us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/ITSHISTORYfb\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/thehistoryshow\nYour photos on Instagram: https://instagram.com/itshistorychannel\n\n\u00bb Interested in the First World War?

But who turned the simple principle of a steam engine into the speedy steel locomotives, frequenting thousands of kilometers of railroads and connecting the world during the Industrial Revolution? Soon steam boats and trains accelerated the world and furthered the ever prospering new world.

So many scientists started working on magnetic recordings, which on the long term should increase mobility. Which inventor came up with the audio cassette? And when did re-recording a mixtape for your sweetheart become possible?

                "description": "Nowadays, Jane Austen is one of the world's most well known female authors. Just about everybody has heard of her books like Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility. But when her books were published for the first time, her name was not on the cover. In fact they were published bearing the anonymous pseudonym \u201eBy a Lady\u201c. Her observations of the upper class english society at the end of the 18th century and her literary conception of emancipation and romantic love were not welcome everywhere. Still, she inspired a generation of young women, to question the world they live in. Even though, her books were already on the verge of becoming contemporary classics, to this day, Jane Austen's stories remain present in popular culture, not least because of many film adaptations.\n\n\u00bb The Complete PLAYLIST on THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION:\n\n\u00bb Mentioned Videos:\n\nFighters for Equality: http://bit.ly/IndustrialEmancipation\n\nHistory of Sound Recording: http://bit.ly/HistoryOfSound\n\n\u00bb SOURCES\nVideos: British Path\u00e9 (https://www.youtube.com/user/britishpathe)\nPictures: mainly Picture Alliance\n\n\u00bb JOIN OUR COMMUNITY FOR MORE HISTORY KNOWLEDGE!\nWrite us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/ITSHISTORYfb\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/thehistoryshow\nYour photos on Instagram: https://instagram.com/itshistorychannel\n\n\u00bb Interested in the First World War?

                    "description": "Nowadays, Jane Austen is one of the world's most well known female authors. Just about everybody has heard of her books like Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility. But when her books were published for the first time, her name was not on the cover. In fact they were published bearing the anonymous pseudonym \u201eBy a Lady\u201c. Her observations of the upper class english society at the end of the 18th century and her literary conception of emancipation and romantic love were not welcome everywhere. Still, she inspired a generation of young women, to question the world they live in. Even though, her books were already on the verge of becoming contemporary classics, to this day, Jane Austen's stories remain present in popular culture, not least because of many film adaptations.\n\n\u00bb The Complete PLAYLIST on THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION:\n\n\u00bb Mentioned Videos:\n\nFighters for Equality: http://bit.ly/IndustrialEmancipation\n\nHistory of Sound Recording: http://bit.ly/HistoryOfSound\n\n\u00bb SOURCES\nVideos: British Path\u00e9 (https://www.youtube.com/user/britishpathe)\nPictures: mainly Picture Alliance\n\n\u00bb JOIN OUR COMMUNITY FOR MORE HISTORY KNOWLEDGE!\nWrite us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/ITSHISTORYfb\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/thehistoryshow\nYour photos on Instagram: https://instagram.com/itshistorychannel\n\n\u00bb Interested in the First World War?

We can find such festivals everywhere in the world and in our history. We will explain how and why people celebrated in the course of history and what prompted them to do so.\n\nWhat do you think about such festivals?

The \u201cBeer Festival\u201d or \u201cOktoberfest\u201d is one of the biggest events in Germany. This celebration takes place in many German cities but the biggest and most famous one is held in Munich. Millions of people from all around the world come here to celebrate and break with the drab monotony of everyday life. \n\nBut the Beer Festival is not a solitary case. We can find such festivals everywhere in the world and in our history. We will explain how and why people celebrated in the course of history and what prompted them to do so.\n\nWhat do you think about such festivals? Do you happily join the celebrating mob or do you think that big events where people get drunk and reckless are a danger to society?
